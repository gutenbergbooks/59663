<h3>PREFACE</h3>

<p>This chapter on diseases of swine has been written
with the purpose of placing in the hands of Students
and the Veterinary Profession, a book of practical
worth; hence, all unnecessary technical language or
terms have been eliminated and only such language used
as all may read and understand.</p>

<p>The treatment recommended in each disease is one
I have used and found efficient in my many years of
practice as a Veterinary Surgeon.</p>

<p>If my readers will study the following chapter carefully,
they will save much unnecessary loss to the swine
industry and be of great value to the community in
which they reside.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>HOG REGULATOR AND TONIC.</h3>

<p>Nux Vomica, one pound; Hardwood Charcoal, two
pounds; Sulphur, two pounds; Common Salt, three
pounds; Sulphide of Antimony, one and one-half
pounds; Glauber Salts, two pounds; Bicarbonate of
Soda, four pounds; Hyposulphite of Soda, four pounds;
Nitrate of Potash, one pound; Quassia, one-half pound;
Gentian Root, one pound; Iron Sulphate, one pound;
pulverize and mix well.</p>

<p>To every one hundred pounds of hog weight, give
one tablespoonful in feed or swill once or twice daily.
For hogs weighing two hundred pounds, the dose would
be two tablespoonfuls; for a hog weighing fifty pounds,
one-half tablespoonful.</p>

<p>Hogs, like other animals, require tonics, bowel regulators
and worm expellers. For these purposes, I have
prescribed under a number of the diseases of hogs, which
I cover in this chapter, the above general tonic and regulator
which I have used in my personal practice with
marked success, especially serving the purpose of aiding
hogs in the convalescence from debilitating diseases
and in their recovery from a general run-down condition.</p>

<p>Aside from its general tonic and regulative effect,
this prescription contains nerve tonics, intestinal antiseptics,
laxatives, worm expellers, and aids digestion,
etc.</p>

<p>If regularly given to hogs, and sanitary conditions
are maintained, this tonic and regulator will largely
fortify them against contagious diseases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<h3>ABORTION.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Sows may abort at any state of pregnancy
by slipping, falling, receiving kicks, or by being caught
while crawling through or under fences. Sows may also
abort when allowed to crawl into quarters where there
are other hogs. Contagious diseases, such as Cholera
and Pleuropneumonia also produce abortion. There is
also a contagious form of abortion in sows, but this is
very uncommon, as the disease spreads very slowly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—There is no warning given, as a rule;
the sows expel their pigs before any signs of abortion are
noticed.</p>

<p>In other cases the sows refuse to eat, become uneasy,
shivering and trembling of the muscles, and straining or
labor pains are noticed. As a rule, when a sow aborts,
she will not prepare a bed, as she would normally.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Preventive is the only safe and sure
treatment, although when the first signs of abortion appear,
and there are no signs of the membranes coming
away, remove the sow to quiet, warm, clean quarters by
herself, and if straining, give one dram of Chloral-Hydrate
in her drinking water every two or three hours.</p>

<p>When a sow aborts, burn the pigs and afterbirth, and
disinfect the pens with a Coal Tar disinfectant. Keep
this up for several days, and do not breed until all discharges
from the vagina have ceased flowing.</p>

<h3>ADMINISTRATION OF MEDICINE TO HOGS.</h3>

<p>To administer medicine to hogs may seem easy, but,
nevertheless, it is a difficult task. Never lay a hog on
his back to drench him, as in so doing there is great
danger of strangling. The proper method is to stand
or set him on end, holding him up by the ears, and by
the use of a bottle with a piece of hose drawn over its
neck, give the medicine very slowly, so as not to allow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
a large quantity to accumulate in the mouth or throat
at one time. There is always danger of some of the
liquid escaping into the lungs and causing the hog to
strangle, and thus it may produce pneumonia. However,
this is the best method of giving hogs medicine by
force.</p>

<p>Hogs will generally take medicine in their feed or
drinking water, unless they are very sick, or the medicine
is extremely disagreeable to the taste.</p>

<h3>BAG INFLAMMATION.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Injuries, obstructed teats, accumulation of
milk in the sow’s bag after the loss of part or all of
her litter. Difficult birth, slight wounds in the bag permit
invasion of germs, which is frequently the common
cause of bag inflammation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Heat, pain and swelling in one or more
teats. The general body temperature is elevated one or
two degrees above normal. The sow perhaps refuses
her feed, although she will drink water in large quantities.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Feed soft, sloppy food and vegetables.
Give Epsom Salts, two to four ounces, in milk or
feed. It is also well to milk the sow by hand, relieving her
of the milk three or four times a day. This is very necessary.
Camphorated Oil is very soothing, and I would
recommend its use freely over affected teats.</p>

<h3>BLACK TOOTH.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Black Tooth, so called in swine, is principally
due to injuries to the teeth received by chewing
hard matter, such as bone, etc., which causes them to decay.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Toothache. Toothache in swine is
similar to that exhibited by man, in showing loss of appetite,
salivation, or slobbering, hanging the head mostly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
to the side which is affected, loss of fear of man, and
offensive breath. If the hogs are fed on strongly acid
food for any length of time, their teeth may become
dark colored. As the teeth are not materially injured,
so long as decayed tooth substance cannot be noticed,
and while the appetite and chewing facilities of the hog
do not appear to be diminished, no interference will be
necessary.</p>

<p>It is customary with some people to examine the teeth
of hogs, and if one tooth is found darker colored than
the others, it is supposed to be the cause of the hog not
doing well, if he is in poor condition, and the tooth is
hammered off flush with the jaw, leaving the broken
roots, lacerated gums and nerves to increase the hog’s
suffering. If the hog recovers, it is often concluded that
this was a case of Black Tooth.</p>

<p>My advice is, if you are determined to have the tooth
out, extract it properly. Do not break it off. When
your hogs are not thriving, give them the regulator and
tonic prescribed on the first page of this chapter.</p>

<h3>BLOOD POISONING.<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Pyemia Septicemia</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Due to the toxic substance produced by
germs that invade wounds, bruises, abscesses, or womb
following farrowing, if lacerated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—The seat of injury becomes swollen,
pus may adhere to the hair, temperature elevated, appetite
poor, hog moves about very slowly, becomes separated
from the rest of the drove, lies around in some
cool, quiet place, eventually becomes very weak and
poor and dies, if good attention is not given.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Separate from the other hogs and remove
to a clean, comfortable place and wash the seat
of injury with some good disinfectant, as a five per cent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Carbolic Acid solution. In cases of abscess, open it low
so as to assure good drainage. Keep clean, cool water
before your hogs at all times. Give mashes made from
wheat bran and hot water, or any good substantial food
that is easily digested containing regulator and tonic
prescribed on the first page of this chapter.</p>

<h3>BRONCHITIS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Lung worms, poorly ventilated sleeping
quarters, sleeping in straw stacks, in manure heaps,
over-heated, filthy pens, where the animals inhale irritating
gases given off the bodies of other hogs, and from
filth. Smoke and dust are very common producers of
bronchitis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Breathing fast, appetite poor, slight
rise in temperature and coughing. The hog is dull and
stupid, refuses food, but drinks water frequently.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Preventive; avoid the above named
causes, but when hogs become affected, move them to
clean, well ventilated quarters, avoiding dust and gases,
disinfect bedding and floors with some good disinfectant,
as Crude Carbolic Acid, sprayed. Also give large doses
of the hog regulator and tonic as prescribed on the first
page of this chapter. Feed vegetables, or any easily
digested food, and hot wheat bran mashes.</p>

<p>In case the disease is due to lung worms, confine the
animals in a closed shed and permit them to inhale the
steam from Turpentine and water for a few minutes, by
placing water and Turpentine in a tin receptacle holding
about two gallons, and inserting heated bricks or stones
into the solution.</p>

<h3>CASTRATION.</h3>

<p>This is generally understood by every stockraiser,
yet there are some points many do not know. For
instance, you should use in this operation an antiseptic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
solution, as Carbolic Acid or Bichloride of Mercury.
Wash thoroughly with antiseptic your hands and knife,
also the seat of operation and make your incision as low
as possible to permit the pus to drain out nicely. If this
is not practiced, the pus will become absorbed into the
blood, producing blood poison, which may produce death,
or at the best will cause the hog to become stunted,
whereas, if the operation is performed properly, the hog
will thrive, regardless of the shock from the operation.
I may add that it is much better to castrate pigs or
hogs when their stomachs or intestines are empty, and
it is always good practice to feed laxative and easily
digested foods sparingly after this operation.</p>

<h3>CHOKING.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Vegetables such as potatoes, etc., roots, as
carrots, turnips and sometimes pieces of bone or glass,
lodge in the gullet. Paralysis of the muscular fibres of
the gullet is a very common cause of choking in swine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—The hog is unable to swallow, producing
a frothing at the mouth and, if the obstruction cannot
be dislodged, death occurs in a very short time. Sometimes
the obstruction in the gullet may be felt from the
outside with the hand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—The administration of small doses of
Raw Linseed or Olive Oil, or Lard, will assist in dislodging
the obstruction. Also careful manipulation of the
gullet from the outside with the hand assists in either
forcing it into the stomach or bringing it out through
hog’s mouth. If vomiting can be produced, it will dislodge
the obstruction. If immediate results are not
obtained from the above treatments, I would recommend
butchering the hog for meat immediately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<h3>COLD IN THE HEAD.<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Nasal Catarrh</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Exposure to cold; a very common condition
in cold, wet weather when hogs are allowed to sleep in
manure heaps, straw stacks, or pile up together, when
they become over-heated and later chill. Nasal Catarrh
may also be due to inhaling dust or irritating gases.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—The animal is stupid and feverish,
coughing and sneezing frequently; appetite is poor, eyes
watery and inflamed; a discharge of mucus from the
nose will terminate in yellow pus and the nose, if examined,
is found to be inflamed and ulcerated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—The best and safest treatment is to
provide clean sleeping quarters, avoid overcrowding in
dusty, dirty sheds, especially during cold weather. Pigs
affected with cold in the head should be fed on laxative
food, such as boiled carrots, potatoes, apples, hot wheat
bran mashes and steamed rolled oats.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Medical Treatment.</span>—Confine the affected hogs to
a shed, close windows and doors and any large cracks;
then compel them to inhale steam from the following
mixture: Turpentine, eight ounces; Pine Tar, one pint;
Water, two gallons. Place in tin receptacle in center of
shed and heat the above solution by adding hot bricks
or stones to the mixture occasionally. Compel the hogs
to inhale this steam for at least thirty minutes twice a
day. Give chlorate of Potash in twenty grain doses
three times a day in feed or drinking water. This treatment
is very successful if the inflammation has not extended
to the lungs.</p>

<h3>DIARRHOEA IN YOUNG PIGS.<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Scours</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Decomposed foods, slops, etc., fed to the
mothers, causing them to give toxic milk. Poorly ventilated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
filthy, cold and damp pens, insufficient exercise,
lack of sunlight, raising pigs by hand or with other sow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Frequent movement of the bowels, the
passage being of a grayish-white color and the odor very
disagreeable. At this stage of the disease, reliable remedies
must be given or the pig will die very soon.</p>

<p>The discharge from the bowels becomes very thin, the
tail and legs become soiled, loss of appetite, the pigs
become weak and dull, hair rough and it is difficult for
them to move about. In very young pigs, treatment is
of little value.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—As Scours in pigs is a disease frequently
caused by faulty food and insanitary surroundings,
a preventive treatment is of great importance, and
much better results are thus obtained than by the use of
medical agents. Medical treatment consists in first
cleaning away the irritant present in the bowels. For
this purpose give one to two teaspoonfuls of Castor Oil.
At the time of farrowing all sows should receive a light
diet and be kept in clean, dry quarters. The pigs should
be allowed pure air, sunshine and exercise. If the sow
appears hot and feverish, give one to three ounces of
Castor Oil in milk or swill. Avoid feeding decomposed,
moldy food, or sour milk. To check the diarrhoea in
pigs, use the following after the irritant is removed or
cleaned out as above stated: Zinc Sulphocarbolates,
thirty grains; Protan, two ounces; Pulv. Gentian Root,
two ounces. Make into sixty capsules or powders and
give one, three or four times a day. The sow should receive
a dose about eight times the size of that of the pigs.</p>

<h3>HOG CHOLERA.<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Swine Fever</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—By the Bacillus Sius; contaminated food,
stagnant water, filth, etc., all have a tendency to aid its
progress. I have seen farms, although located in sections
where Cholera was prevalent, not in the least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
troubled with the malady, perhaps due to careful feeding
of clean foods, care in watering, cleanliness about the
pens and sheds and disinfecting occasionally, but no
doubt a better explanation is that those hogs received
tonics, containing worm expellers, at least four times a
year. Many a case of supposed Hog Cholera is due to
worms irritating and producing inflammation of the intestines,
followed by diarrhoea. A person not familiar
with the disease calls this “hog cholera.” In other cases,
hogs which are fed swills from restaurants, hotels, etc.,
containing soap, washing powders, small particles of
glass, etc., will die with symptoms leading a person to
think they had Hog Cholera, but if a thorough investigation
is made the true cause of death can easily be discovered.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—In true Hog Cholera, the temperature
will be elevated two to four degrees above normal.
There will be a loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhoea, although
there may be constipation when the hog is first
affected. The hog wanders off by itself to some cool,
quiet place and lies down. When it walks it will stagger
and show great stiffness in its hind parts, due to soreness
of the intestines. The hair will have a roughened
appearance, the back arched, the eyes inflamed and discharging
pus, red blotches will show themselves back of
the ears, inside the legs and on the abdomen. At this
stage the diarrhoea is watery, dark and tinged with
blood, and very offensive in odor, breathing is very fast
and labored. The hog grows very weak and dies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Prevention must always be borne in
mind. Do not feed filthy food. Always feed good,
wholesome food, and give clean water to drink. Watch
the condition of hog’s bowels and regulate them by feeding.
Burn manure and bedding and disinfect carefully.
Do not permit your hogs to drink out of running streams
of water, especially if Hog Cholera is in your neighborhood.
When buying hogs, it is well to keep them off by
themselves for two or three weeks, as they may be diseased.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Do not permit neighbors, their stock or dogs on
premises when Hog Cholera is raging, as the infection
of Hog Cholera can be spread very rapidly by matter
from the affected hogs adhering to the shoes of man, to
the feet of stock and hogs, etc.</p>

<p>I am positive that if this method were properly practiced
by all hog raisers and feeders, Hog Cholera would
be a very rare disease.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Serum Treatment.</span>—This is successful in some
cases, and in others unsuccessful. The latter perhaps is
due to poor serums, or the disease being so far advanced
in its progress that the hogs are beyond recovery. Serum
treatment is very expensive and, as it requires a strictly
septic operation of injecting the serum, the average hog
raiser or grower is not qualified to administer the treatment
properly. An additional and necessary expense is
the services of a Veterinary Surgeon. Therefore, I
strongly urge adoption of preventive measures as stated.
Use some good disinfectant, such as Crude Carbolic
Acid, which destroys the Bacillus of Hog Cholera. Also
administer hog regulator and tonic as prescribed on first
page of this chapter. This will expel worms, tone the
system, regulate the bowels and fortify your hogs against
Hog Cholera.</p>

<h3>INDIGESTION.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Worms are perhaps one of the most common
causes. Unwholesome, irritating food or swill containing
soap or washing powder have a tendency to derange
the process of digestion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Abdominal pain, vomiting, back
arched, breathing rapid and temperature elevated from
two to three degrees. There may be diarrhoea or the
animal may be constipated. Vomiting, as a rule, relieves
acute attacks by expelling the irritant from the bowels.
When it takes a chronic form, the hogs become stunted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Endeavor to find out the cause and remove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
it. If constipated, give Calomel, fifteen to twenty
grains, or, if diarrhoea appears, give hog regulator and
tonic as prescribed on first page of this chapter. Feed
with hot wheat bran mashes. This will expel all worms
and aid digestion.</p>

<h3>JAUNDICE.<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Yellows</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Liver flukes, intestinal worms, gall stones,
lack of exercise, overfeeding, or a stoppage of the bile
duct.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—The white portions of the eyes take on
a yellow color, as do the membranes of the mouth, back
arched, hair looks rough, vomiting, temperature elevated,
constipation, although diarrhoea is sometimes
noticed. The urine is passed frequently, and is of a dark
amber color.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—This disease requires careful feeding
and plenty of exercise. Give Calomel, ten to twenty
grains, then follow with large doses of regulator and
tonic as prescribed on first page of this chapter. It is
important in this disease, especially if due to worms.
Feed clean swill and vegetables. Give hogs all the pure
water they will drink.</p>

<h3>KIDNEY CONGESTION.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Hogs are subject to various injuries about
the kidneys, due to a large number of hogs piling up,
exposure to cold, wet rains, etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Small quantities of dark colored urine
are passed frequently, appetite poor, no energy to move
about. Hogs lie around a great deal; at times they may
be paralyzed and drag their hind quarters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Apply cloths or blankets wrung out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
of hot water over the loin; also give Potassium Acetate
in twenty grain doses four or five times a day in drinking
water. Feed soft, sloppy food, containing regulator and
tonic as prescribed on the first page of this chapter. It
contains nerve stimulants, just what is required in
paralysis.</p>

<h3>KIDNEY WORM.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Damp, filthy surroundings seem to favor
the growth of embryos of this worm. They are taken
into the digestive canal with the food and eventually pass
to the region of the kidneys, where they find conditions
favorable in which to multiply.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—May produce paralysis of the hind
quarters, in which case the animal would not exhibit such
marked tenderness on being pressed over the loins with
the fingers as it would if the weakness of the hind quarters
was due to a sprain or to rheumatism of the loins.
Occasionally hogs may suffer from the presence of one
or more worms in the kidneys; but the ailment is rarely
fatal, becoming so only after a long time of suffering
resulting in a degeneration of one or both kidneys. It
is almost impossible to diagnose the presence of worms
in the kidneys of hogs, except by chance through a microscopic
examination of the urine. If worms are found in
the kidneys of a hog that has died or has been slaughtered
for food it may then be reasonably supposed that other
hogs of the same herd not acting normal are infected
with worms of the same species.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Teaspoonful doses of Turpentine in
milk three times a week is the only treatment I could
recommend. Preventive measures is the only practical
method of treating a disease of this nature. Give your
hogs pure water and food. Disinfect pens occasionally
and keep them clean.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<h3>LICE ON HOGS.</h3>

<p>Dip, spray or scrub your hogs with some good Coal
Tar disinfectant, but whatever remedy is used it should
be applied more than once which, of course, causes considerable
work where there is a large number of hogs
infested, unless dipped, which is more quickly done.
The reason for repeated applications being necessary is
that although the lice which hogs pick up from the
ground, bedding and rubbing places, may be killed by
first application, it often does not affect the nits, which
remain intact and hatch within a week or ten days. A
new crop of Lice appears on the hog from this source.
Remove all manure and bedding from pens and sheds
and burn it. Disinfect floors and spray sides of shed,
pens and rubbing places with disinfectants, one part to
seventy-two parts of water, once a month and you will
be handsomely repaid for your labor.</p>

<h3>LUNG FEVER.<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Inflammation of the Lungs</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Sudden changes, exposure to storms, piling
up of hogs during cold nights, or sleeping in manure
heaps, old straw stacks, etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Pig or hog is taken with shivering
spells, is stupid, his back is arched, loss of appetite, temperature
elevated two to four degrees above normal,
short hurried breathing, generally accompanied with
cough, which is deep and hoarse. As a rule the hog is
constipated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Place in good, clean, warm, well ventilated
quarters, free from drafts. Keep water before
them at all times, adding Saltpeter, one teaspoonful to
every gallon of water. If constipated, do not give
physics; give injections of soap and warm water; also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
administer about one-half teaspoonful of Pine Tar on
the tongue with a wooden paddle. This adheres to the
tongue and gradually dissolves and gives excellent results,
as it is very soothing to the organs of breathing.
During the convalescent stage, give hog regulator and
tonic as prescribed on first page of this chapter.</p>

<h3>LUNG WORMS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—By thread-like worms varying in length
from one-half to one and one-half inches and of brownish-white
color. They are found in the windpipe and
tubes leading into the lungs. The adult worms in the
lungs produce large quantities of eggs, which are
coughed up with mucus and become scattered over premises
where other hogs are permitted to walk. The hogs
inhale the dust containing the eggs into their lungs,
where the eggs find moisture sufficient for their development.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Severe coughing spells. Large quantities
of mucus will escape from the nose and mouth.
The hog becomes stunted, although he may eat fairly
well, but if not relieved, the worms collect in the Bronchi
and produce sudden death due to suffocation. The
worms may set up an inflammation of the lining membranes
of the lungs, which is sometimes taken for Swine
Plague, or Cholera. This disease is not uncommon, especially
in old, filthy, poorly drained hog houses and
pastures.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Confine the affected hogs to a shed;
close the windows and doors and any large cracks, then
compel the hogs to inhale steam from the following
mixture: Turpentine, eight ounces; Pine Tar, one pint;
Water, two gallons. Place in tin receptacle in center of
the shed and heat the above solution by adding hot
bricks or stones to the mixture occasionally. Compel
them to inhale this steam for at least thirty minutes
twice a day. Feed wholesome food to which add hog<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
tonic as prescribed on first page of this chapter. A
strong, vigorous hog may have worms, but it retains its
vitality so long as it is well fed.</p>

<h3>MANGE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—By the Sarcoptes Scabei. This parasite
burrows under the outer surface of the skin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—The parasite usually manifests itself on
the skin under the armpits, thighs and inside of the fore
legs. At first small red blotches or pimples appear, and
these gradually spread as the parasites multiply and
burrow under the skin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—There is no other way of curing this
disease, or of preventing it, than by killing the parasites
and their eggs; not only on the pigs themselves, but also
on the sides of the pens, sheds, rubbing-posts, or anything
that an affected hog rubs against.</p>

<p>When treating this disease, the real aim must be to
kill the parasite by the prompt and continuous use of
external remedies, such as washing or dipping, which
is better done with some good disinfectant, one part to
seventy parts water. Repeat this every ten days until
cured. Two dippings are generally sufficient. It is well
to feed cooling foods, such as clean slops and vegetables,
containing regulator and tonic as prescribed on first page
of this chapter.</p>

<h3>NAVEL RUPTURE.<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Navel or Umbilical</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Injuries. Pigs crowding through narrow
doorways or openings in fences, small pigs sleeping with
large pigs, and allowed to pile up, or being thrown about
feed troughs when feeding. Weakness and constipation
also predisposes them to Navel or Umbilical Rupture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—A soft, puffy swelling about the navel
or umbilicus, varying in size from a hazelnut to that of
an ostrich egg. When a pig is placed on its back the
intestines will gravitate into the abdominal cavity, providing
the intestines have not adhered to the walls of
the rupture.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—This is more difficult than the Scrotal
or Inguinal Rupture operation, as often times the intestines
will adhere to the inner surface of the rupture and,
unless the operation is carefully performed, there is
great danger. Great care must be exercised in preparing
the pig by fasting it for twenty-four hours. After
this is accomplished, prepare an antiseptic solution,
Carbolic Acid, five per cent, or Bichloride of Mercury,
one in one-thousandths; also have a needle and absorbent
silk or cat-gut ready. Place the pig on its back, with its
head downward. Now, wash the seat of operation with
either antiseptic solution. Then make an incision
through the skin carefully; as stated before, intestines
sometimes adhere to the inner surface of the rupture.
If such is the case, wash the hands in the antiseptic
solution and with the fingers carefully break the
adhesions or separate the intestines from their adhesions.
After this is accomplished, sew the inner lining
of the abdominal cavity with absorbent silk or cat-gut.
Then sew the outer skin with cotton or linen cord and
your operation is complete. Feed the hog sparingly for
a few days following the operation on easily digested,
laxative foods.</p>

<h3>NETTLE RASH.<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Urticaira</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Irritations of the skin produced by sprinkling
hogs with irritating solutions and powders, or from
irritating dips when treating for lice, etc. Feeding
highly nitrogenous food predisposes hogs to this disease;
also filth, poorly drained sheds and pens; is especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
common in young pigs. Nettle Rash is not contagious,
but what produces it in one hog may produce it in several
at the same time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Red, swollen blotches appear on the
skin very suddenly, especially about the ears and the inside
of the thighs, perhaps due to the skin being thin and
deprived of hair. The hog rubs account of the
intense itching, and he will not thrive when in this condition.
In most cases there is a fluid oozing from the
blotches, causing dirt and filth to adhere to the hair.
However, if the disease is properly treated, a recovery
is sure to follow in about two weeks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Prevention against this disease is most
important, and it consists in keeping shoats and pigs
in clean, well ventilated sheds and pens. Do not sprinkle
them with irritating solutions or powders, or irritating
dips, but when the disease once shows itself give each
pig or hog affected a dose of Epsom Salts, one ounce
to every twenty-five pounds of hog weight, in feed, swill
or drinking water. If the weather is hot, keep them in
a clean, cool place, also purify their blood by feeding
regulator and tonic as prescribed on first page of this
chapter.</p>

<p>Apply some good Coal Tar disinfectant, one part to
one hundred parts of water. This is non-irritating, and
will destroy hog lice, and will heal the pustules of nettle
rash. Apply twice ten days apart. It also must be
borne in mind that pens and sleeping quarters must be
disinfected; the old bedding and manure burned and
replaced with good, clean straw or hay. Feed easily
digested food, slops, etc.</p>

<h3>PARALYSIS OF THE HIND QUARTERS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—There are a great many things that may
produce paralysis of the hind quarters. For instance,
shipping hogs in crates; fractions of thigh bones; Rickets,
due to feeding food that is deficient in mineral matter;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
hogs piling up; kicks or injuries to the back; frequently
seen in sows nursing a litter of pigs and in a run-down
condition. Constipation and indigestion also produce
paralysis of the hind quarters. Some think it is
caused by worms in the kidneys; this is not always the
case. It is true that the presence of a parasite around
the kidneys may cause irritation of the nerves of the
spinal column and result in paralysis. Yet, it is more
often the result of weakness and loss of nervous power
of the hind parts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Regardless of the cause, the symptoms
in either case, for they cannot be distinguished, are
weakness of the back, wriggling of the hind parts, and
finally the hogs sit down on their haunches. After some
effort, they get up and run in a straight line quite fast,
but swing to one side for a while and then go over to
the other side, and finally get down so that they cannot
rise, but drag themselves about. The appetite is good
until a day or two before they die.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Place the hog in clean, comfortable
quarters, with plenty of fresh water to drink. Give sour
milk, fruit or vegetables, containing regulator and tonic
as prescribed on first page of this chapter. It contains
nerve stimulants and blood purifiers. If the hog is constipated,
add two to four ounces of Epsom Salts to its
feed.</p>

<p>Treatment of all such cases requires perseverance,
recovery being slow and not always certain.</p>

<h3>PILES.<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Prolapse of the Anus</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Although the pig may look well, he has a
weakness of the circular fibres of the intestines, due to
irritating foods that either constipate or produce diarrhoea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Very plain. A protrusion of the rectum
all the way from two to four inches. The pig irritates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
the protrusion by rubbing it against the sides of pens,
etc.; it cracks, bleeds and in warm weather will become
fly-blown and maggots accumulate in large quantities.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—In the first stages of this disease, wash
the protruded parts with an antiseptic solution of Carbolic
Acid, one teaspoonful to a pint of water. Give
rectal injections of Soap and Warm Water or Sweet
Oil, give about two ounces of Castor Oil internally and
feed soft, sloppy food. In chronic cases of long standing,
remove the exposed portion of the intestine after
washing nicely with the antiseptic solution. Remove
the protrusion with a sharp knife and stitch the cut end
of intestine edges to the anus. Feed easily digested food,
such as wheat bran, mixed with flaxseed meal on which
boiling hot water has been poured, cooling before feeding.
Also give regulator and tonic as prescribed on first
page of this chapter.</p>

<h3>PIN WORMS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Hogs consume the eggs that encapsule well
matured embryonic worms with their food or drinking
water. These worms multiply very rapidly in the small
intestines and are from one-half to one inch in length.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—No signs are noticed unless the worms
are very abundant, as they are small and difficult to see
with the naked eye. The principal point of attack is in
the back part of the small intestines, where considerable
inflammation is set up, especially when there are other
worms, such as the Roundworm, present.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Is of little value, as the worms in the
intestines are very difficult to get at, but as their presence
causes very little disturbance, it is hardly worth
while treating; however, preventive measures should be
applied by disinfecting, burning manure and bedding.</p>

<p>The following has proven a very effective treatment
for Pinworms: Powdered Quassia, one pound; Sulphur,
two pounds; Glauber Salts, one pound; Powdered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Tobacco, one-half pound; Sulphide of Antimony, one
pound; Hyposulphite of Soda, two pounds; Beechwood
Charcoal, one pound; Common Salt, two pounds.</p>

<p>The above must be well powdered and thoroughly
mixed. Give one heaping teaspoonful to every one hundred
pounds of hog weight. To small pigs, give doses
in proportion to weight. Place it in their feed or slop
twice a day. In addition to being a vermifuge, it is an
alterative and tonic that should be given pigs and hogs
which do not thrive properly. Best results are obtained
in treatment of Pinworm when the principal food consists
of vegetables, mashes and slops.</p>

<h3>PLEURISY.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Exposure to cold, damp, chilly weather, especially
to drafts, or by a large number of hogs being
allowed to pile up during cold nights, etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Chilling, temperature elevated two or
three degrees above normal; breathing fast. The hog
will show great pain when pressed over the lungs by
flinching, squealing or grunting; couching suppressed,
ribs rigid; breathing mostly with the muscles of the
flanks; appetite poor and eventually there will be fluids
accumulate in the lung cavities. At this stage, the
breathing is labored and difficult. If the ear is pressed
over the lungs, the fluids can be heard, and in the first
stage the sound will be similar to that of rubbing hair
between the finger and thumb.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Remove the cause. The treatment is
satisfactory if applied in due time. Place in clean, comfortable
shed, seeing that it is well ventilated, omit
drafts; apply equal parts of Aqua Ammonia Fort., Turpentine
and Sweet Oil over the lungs and give two or
four ounces of Castor Oil in milk. Feed easily digested
food, such as hot wheat bran mashes, containing hog
regulator and tonic as prescribed on first page of this
chapter. It is also well to feed vegetables.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<h3>RHEUMATISM.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Exposure, as in cold, damp houses. Overfeeding
also has a tendency to cause swellings of the
joints and muscles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Lameness of one or more limbs, swelling
of the joints about the legs and feet. The hog does
not care to move, refusing its feed in most cases: temperature
slightly elevated; breathing quick and short; he
will drink water frequently if offered.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—I am of opinion that Rheumatism in
hogs would be a very rare disease if they were properly
provided with clean, dry quarters, with a liberal quantity
of bedding. Do not allow hogs to pile up, as it is very
injurious to them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Medical Treatment.</span>—Consists of feeding sloppy
food to which add one-half dram of Sodium Salicylate
two or three times a day in their feed. Vegetables and
green grass are very beneficial in this disease, as they
have a cooling effect on the blood. The hog tonic and
regulator recommended on first page of this chapter is
very beneficial when given with food of a sloppy nature.</p>

<h3>RICKETS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Food deficient in mineral matter or lime;
filth, lack of exercise, and crowded quarters, all tend to
produce a softening of the bones and swelling of the
joints.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—The pigs affected generally appear in
good condition and seem to be doing well, but suddenly
they become paralyzed in the hind quarters, owing to the
weakened condition of the bones, which sometimes fracture
without receiving injury or any additional weight
to that of the pig itself. The bones of the snout, back,
limbs and feet bend and become deformed. The pigs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
grow weak, poor and stunted and perhaps the best treatment
is to destroy them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Preventive Treatment.</span>—Careful feeding of good,
wholesome food. This disease is very seldom seen where
hogs are frequently fed corn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Medical Treatment.</span>—When the first signs of
Rickets appear, feed regulator and tonic as prescribed
on first page of this chapter. It contains the mineral
matter needed by the hog.</p>

<h3>ROUND WORMS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Is undoubtedly due to filth or hogs eating
food or drinking water contaminated with well developed
eggs or embryos of roundworms, thus taking them into
their digestive canal, where they multiply rapidly and
set up considerable irritation. This worm varies in
length from three to thirteen inches, and is of a reddish-brown
color.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—The Roundworm is generally passed
with the feces, and can be readily seen with the naked
eye. A hog infested with a large number of these worms
is generally restless, appetite varied. When these
worms develop in large numbers, they obstruct the intestines.
In other cases they irritate and inflame the
intestines, causing inflammation and diarrhoea, and
death may be due to either obstruction or inflammation of
the bowels.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Treatment is very satisfactory. Withhold
all food from eighteen to twenty-four hours. Then
place in one pint of finely ground feed, Calomel and
Santonin, each five grains to every one hundred pounds
of hog weight. For instance, if the hog affected with
round worms weighs two hundred pounds, double the
dose by giving ten grains of each of the above, but if the
hog only weighs fifty pounds, give one-half the dose mentioned,
or two and one-half grains of each. This treatment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
should be repeated in a week or ten days to assure
the expulsion of worms that might have survived the
first dose. Feed sparingly on laxative food, as bran
mashes and vegetables, for a few days following each
treatment.</p>

<h3>RUPTURE.<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Scrotal or Inguinal</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Definition.</span>—In the male the intestines pass through
the wide Inguinal Canal, through which the cord of the
testicle passes. It is not difficult to recognize this form
of rupture, as the scrotum that normally retains only
the testicles is usually enlarged by the bowels entering
it. Sometimes the scrotum almost reaches the ground,
and in this case, both sides of the scrotum, or the sack
which contains the testicles, also contains intestines. If
the pig is held up by the hind parts, the intestines will
gravitate back into the abdominal cavity, but as soon as
a pig lies down or stands they again return into the scrotum.
The testicles can be located at the bottom of the
enlargement.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Hereditary tendencies predisposes them to
rupture; pigs having large Inguinal Canals through
which the testicle passes; by pigs being crowded, injured,
squeezed at troughs, or passing through narrow
doorways. Weakness and severe straining from constipation
also produce rupture.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—An enlargement of the sack containing
the testicles. Sometimes there may be a strangulation
of the intestines where they fold or twist. They become
inflamed and produce death. The pig dies in great pain,
but fortunately, strangulated ruptures in pigs are
very rare, as the scrotum and canal which the intestines
occupy relax and become very roomy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Operation is the only method of relieving
or curing Inguinal or Scrotal Rupture. My advice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
is to operate as soon as possible. When the pigs are
small, there is less danger. The pig to be operated on
should be fasted for at least twenty-four hours, as it is
easier on both the operator and the pig when the intestines
are empty, or nearly so.</p>

<p>The operation which I have found to be very successful
is as follows: Have an assistant hold the pig up
by its hind legs. Prepare an antiseptic solution of Carbolic
Acid five per cent, or Bichloride of Mercury, one
in one-thousandths, in a pan. Have a needle threaded
with a medium sized absorbent silk or cat-gut suture.
Prepare a clean, sharp knife; wash the seat of operation
with either antiseptic solution. Now, proceed to locate
the testicle by having the hind parts elevated. The intestines
must be pressed back into the abdominal cavity.
The testicle will remain in the sack or scrotum; now
grasp the testicle between the fingers and make the incision
through the scrotum and to the lower portion. It
may be necessary to insert two fingers to withdraw the
testicle. When the testicle is located, withdraw it. Before
cutting it off it is well to run a needle containing
a thread through the last covering of the testicle so as
to prevent the membrane from returning. After this
is securely done, remove the testicle and sew the inner
membranes that envelop the rupture and testicle with
what is called a “tobacco pouch suture.” Draw it together
firmly and tie and cut off suture about one-half
inch from the knot. Your operation is now complete.
Do not sew the outer incision in the scrotum, as it would
have a tendency to accumulate dirt and hold pus. It
should have a free drainage. Wash with one of the above
mentioned antiseptics twice daily until thoroughly
healed. Also feed laxative foods that are easily digested.</p>

<h3>SORE FEET.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Filth, especially common in large hogs
when confined to hard floors or driven over rough, hard
roads, or continually kept in filthy pens. The tissues of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the feet become softened, especially those between the
claws. Irritation is set up by germs entering the abrasions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—The hogs will be noticed going very
lame and if closely examined the above named conditions
will be found.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Remove the hogs to clean, dry pens
containing plenty of clean bedding, and wash the affected
parts with some good disinfectant, as five per cent
solution of Carbolic Acid. Repeat this treatment at
least once a day. In case the feet are badly inflamed, I
would advise the application of hot Flaxseed Meal poultices
to the feet. Feed easily digested food, as it aids
materially in the treatment of infectious wounds.</p>

<h3>SORE MOUTH.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Decomposed foods. Also slops or stagnant
water, washing powders, broken glassware, etc., from the
tables, fed in slops, barley or wheat beards, etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Difficulty in eating, or refusal to eat
at all. Stringy secretions of saliva continually oozing
from the mouth. The mouth gives off a very offensive
odor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—In this form of sore mouth, remove
the cause. Feed soft, wholesome food, such as wheat
bran mashes and vegetables. In cases where it is due to
the lodging of beards of wheat or barley, gag the hog’s
mouth with a piece of wood and remove the beards with
forceps. Keep clean, cool water before them at all times
and avoid feeding dry, hard food.</p>

<h3>SOWS EATING THEIR YOUNG.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Insufficient lime or mineral matter fed prior
to farrowing; constipation is also a fruitful cause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prevention.</span>—Careful feeding for a few days prior
to farrowing of slops, free from soap or washing powders;
cool food, such as wheat bran mashes, with hog
tonic and regulator as prescribed on the first page of this
chapter. This is loosening to the bowels and also contains
mineral matter and blood purifiers which are very
valuable in the above mentioned condition.</p>

<h3>SUN OR HEAT STROKE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Hogs that are very fat, and driven, hauled
or shipped to market when the weather is warm, are frequently
stricken with heat or sun-stroke. Sometimes
when hogs are overcrowded and not protected from the
rays of the sun, or from heat, they may become victims
of heat or sun-stroke.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—First they stagger when walking, then
they become very weak and temperature elevates three
or four degrees higher than normal. Prostration or extreme
depression, or sometimes involuntary spasms or
contractions of muscles occur.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Prevention. Do not drive, haul or
ship during the hottest part of the day, hogs that are not
accustomed to exercise or extreme heat. Do not crowd
hogs in small pens or sheds during the hot months, as
their bodies give off considerable heat in addition to
that of the sun. See that they are protected from the
sun. When hauling or shipping hogs, wet them occasionally
with water. It prevents heat stroke. In case
a hog is suffering from heat or sun-stroke, place it in a
cool, shady place and apply ice or cold water to the head
only. Also give Saltpeter in teaspoonful doses every
six hours diluted in one ounce of water. Also give
Alcohol, one teaspoonful, every three hours in one ounce
of water. Good recovery is often obtained from the above
treatment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<h3>THORN-HEADED WORMS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—A white grub that is found in old manure
heaps, straw stacks and hog lots carries eggs containing
embryos of the Thorn-headed Worm. The white grub
is eaten by the hog. The larvae of the Thorn-headed
Worm is liberated by the process of digestion and becomes
a parasite in the intestines of the hogs, where it
develops into a fully matured worm. Large numbers of
hogs quickly become infested with this parasite, as they
multiply very rapidly. These worms vary from two to
twelve inches in length, and have a whitish color.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—As a general rule, a worm can be seen
in the feces. Other signs are that the hog loses flesh,
appetite irregular, constipation, and then again there
may be diarrhoea, especially where there are large numbers
of worms present.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—First of all, burn all manure or decomposed
vegetation that the hogs are liable to come in
contact with. Withhold all food from eighteen to twenty-four
hours and give one teaspoonful of Oil of Turpentine
to every one hundred pounds of hog weight, or if the
hog weighs less than one hundred pounds, doses should
be given in proportion. Follow this treatment for three
or, four consecutive days. Turpentine is easily given to
hogs, as they will drink it in milk when well mixed. Perhaps
it is advisable, where a large number of hogs are
affected, to divide them into pens of five or ten hogs,
as they are thus less likely to get an overdose. Feed
laxative food. Clean and disinfect troughs and feeding
floors. Also give prescription on first page of this
chapter.</p>

<h3>THUMPS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Disorders of the digestive system from
overloading the stomach and causing irritation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
nerves leading to the diaphragm, which is the membrane
that separates the lungs and heart from the intestines,
stomach, liver and spleen. It is a spasm of this membrane
that causes a hog or pig to have “Thumps.” Insufficient
exercise; a large number of pigs may become
affected at the same time when closely confined.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Jerking of the flanks; the pig or hog
becomes very weak and stunted in a very short time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Remove the cause. In pigs, when
first affected, careful feeding and exercise will generally
effect a cure. In some cases, where the pigs are very
small, it is well to take them away from the mother, permitting
them to nurse very little. Give them Castor Oil
in teaspoonful doses, and compel them to exercise. It
may be necessary to give them Chloral Hydrate ten to
fifteen grains two or three times a day diluted in a teaspoonful
of water. Where the pigs will not eat mashes
or drink milk, give them medicine by force with a teaspoon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">After Treatment.</span>—Give hog regulator and tonic
as prescribed on first page of this chapter.</p>

<h3>WHIP WORM.</h3>

<p>This worm is very uncommon, but occasionally is
found in the large intestines.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—The eggs become imbedded in the manure,
bedding, etc., and then mix with the food and drinking
water and are taken into the digestive canal where they
develop into matured worms. This worm is from one to
three inches in length, the hind extremity of which is
very thin, hence the name, “Whipworm.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—They produce very little disturbance,
even though present in large quantities, except when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
other worms assist in their irritating the lining membranes
of the large intestines.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Medical Treatment.</span>—Withhold all food from
eighteen to twenty-four hours, then give one teaspoonful
of Gasoline thoroughly mixed with milk, to every one
hundred pounds of hog weight. Small hogs, reduce the
dose in proportion to their weight. It is advisable to
follow this dose for two or three consecutive days. Feed
food that is easily digested, and see that they have fresh
water to drink.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>ABORTION.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Is usually produced by injuries, or by the
ewes being poisoned from eating poisonous foods, plants,
etc. It has never occurred in infectious form in this
country, although sometimes an outbreak is thought infectious
on account of several ewes aborting about the
same time, but all such outbreaks have been traced to
some irritating poison which they had taken with their
food or drinking water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Preventive Treatment.</span>—Remove the aborted
lambs or kids and afterbirth from the yards, and also
withdraw the ewe or nanny and place her in comfortable
quarters. She requires care and extra nursing, or she
will become very poor and lose a large portion of her
fleece.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Medical Treatment.</span>—If due to poisonous plants,
etc., when the first symptoms of Abortion or poisoning
are noticed, give six to ten ounces of Castor Oil. Warm
the oil so it will run freely. Set the sheep or goat upon
its haunches and pour very slowly. Great care must be
exercised so as not to let any of the oil enter the lungs,
as it may produce fatal pneumonia. Feed food that is
easily digested and supply them with pure water to
drink. When the general condition is weak or run
down, so to speak, the following tonic is recommended:
Pulv. Gentian Root, one ounce; Pulv. Nux Vomica, one
ounce; Pulv. Potassium Nitrate, one ounce; Hyposulphite
of Soda, three ounces; Protan, three ounces. Mix
and make into twenty-four powders. Give one powder
two or three times daily well back on the tongue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remember</span> all tonics are bitter, therefore beware of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
any so-called tonics that the animals eat readily, as these
possess no real tonic values.</p>

<h3>BLACK SCOURS.<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Verminous Gastritis—Strongylosis</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Due to a worm (Strongylus Contortus)
measuring one-fourth to one inch in length, inhabiting
the intestines and the fourth stomach of sheep and goats.
This disease is frequently seen in low, marshy pastures,
where animals infested with the worm pass the ova or
egg with the feces, the eggs developing into an embryotic
worm which is again taken with the food or water by
non-infected animals, whereby this disease again attacks
the intestines and fully matured worms develop.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Naturally, the symptoms vary according
to the violence of the attack. In well developed cases,
the animal strains to defecate, and passes shreds of intestinal
mucous along with blood-stained feces. Finally
a severe dysentery takes place, the animal becomes correspondingly
weak, and death takes place in two or three
days. Some cases become chronic, in which death does
not take place for a month or more. However, the
latter is uncommon. Other signs are staggering gait,
trembling, eyes fixed, showing wild expression, neck
turned to one side. Then the animal appears as if in
pain, and looks around at the flank frequently. There is
a chopping of the jaws, and a very free flow of stringy
saliva from the mouth. When an animal dies from the
symptoms just described, it should be cut open and
carefully examined for this particular parasite, which
can be easily seen with the naked eye.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Very successfully treated when the
first symptoms appear by administering one ounce of
Gasoline with a pint of Milk. To lambs or kids give
half the dose. Every precaution should be taken so as to
prevent the drench from entering the lungs. Perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
the best method is to set the animals on its haunches and
pour the liquid slowly and carefully; if they cough, let
them down. Any drench entering the lungs produces
fatal pneumonia. Feed good nourishing food, and supply
them with fresh water to drink.</p>

<h3>CATARRH.<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Cold in the Head</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Atmospheric changes, sudden exposure to
cold, wet weather after being accustomed to warm, comfortable
surroundings, inhaling dust, smoke and gases
or, in fact, anything that will produce an irritation to
the membranes lining the nose; commonly seen in the
spring and fall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Chilling, elevation of temperature,
nose dry, breathing hurried, sneezing, coughing, dullness,
appetite varied. In the first stages of the malady,
the nostrils are considerably inflamed, but in the course
of a few days the temperature subsides and a yellowish-white
discharge flows from the nose continuously.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Keep the affected animals dry, omit
drafts, feed good, wholesome food, and provide bedding
for them to lie upon. In the first stages of this malady,
it is advisable to confine the animals in a barn, closing
the windows and doors and compelling them to inhale
steam from boiling hot water and Pine Tar. The best
method to accomplish this is by placing a tub about half
full of water in the center of the barn and add about one
gallon of Pine Tar. Then heat bricks or stones and
place them into the tub. In this way a large number
can be treated at one time. The sheep should be compelled
to inhale this steam for thirty to forty minutes
twice a day. In addition to the above, the following is
very beneficial: Chlorate of Potash, one ounce; Nitrate
of Potassi, two ounces. Make into sixteen powders and
give one powder to each sheep in its drinking water two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
or three times daily. Feed hot bran mashes and vegetables
if possible.</p>

<h3>DIARRHOEA.<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Dysentery</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Diarrhoea, or Dysentery, is a sign of some
irritation of the intestines resulting in increased secretions,
or increased muscular contraction, or both. The
irritation is sometimes the result of chilling from exposure,
improper feeding, as contaminated or frozen
foods, irritating foods, drinking cold or stagnant water,
indigestion, organic diseases of the intestines, or parasitic
diseases. (See Strongylosis.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Movements from the bowels are frequent,
as first consisting of thin fecal matter, but as
this malady progresses it becomes watery and offensive
in smell, and streaked with blood. At first the animal
shows no constitutional disturbances, but eventually it
becomes weak and shows signs of abdominal pain by
looking around to the flank, throwing the feet together,
lying down, or moving restlessly. Sometimes this disease
is accompanied by fever, great depression, loss of
strength, rapid loss of flesh; terminating in death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Determine the cause and remove it if
possible. When the disease is due to irritating properties
of food which have been fed the animal, it is well
to give a physic of Castor Oil in two to six ounce doses,
according to the size of the animal. When there is
debility, want of appetite, and temperature normal, but
continuous water discharge from the bowels, give Protan,
two ounces; Gum Cathechu, one ounce; Pulv. Ginger,
one ounce; Zinc Sulphocarbolates, eight grains.
Make into sixteen powders and give one powder on the
tongue every three or four hours, according to the severity
of the attack. Feed food that is easily digested, as
wheat bran mashes, steamed rolled oats, etc. See that
the drinking water is fresh and clean.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<h3>FOOT ROT.<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Foul in the Foot</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Foot Rot is produced by inflammation of
the soft structures of the foot between the claws or toes.
It may be due to an overgrowth and inward pressure,
etc., or from filth accumulating and hardening between
the claws, producing inflammation and softening or
ulceration of the skin in the interdigital space (between
the claws). Under some conditions several sheep or
goats in the same drove become affected at the same time,
leading many to think that the disease is contagious.
When Foot Rot appears in a very short time, among
sheep or goats, this condition can almost always be
traced to filth, irritation, etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—The animal is observed to limp when
walking. On careful examination of the foot we find it
hot, swollen above the claws and in the soft parts between
them, frequently spreading the claws apart to a
considerable extent, or the inflammation may have advanced
to softening and sloughing of the soft structure
between the claws. If this condition is neglected at this
stage, deep abscesses form and the pus burrows under
the horny wall, and the joints within the hoof become
inflamed and destroyed, in which case the treatment is
difficult and recovery will be very arduous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—In the early stages of the disease, before
the pus burrows beneath the horny structures of
the foot, any foreign substances impacted between the
claws should be removed. Then place a trough about
one foot wide, six to eight inches high, and twelve to
sixteen feet long, and fill with water and Coal Tar Dip,
diluted in proportions of one part dip to fifty parts of
water. Build a fence on each side of the trough, just
wide enough for one sheep to pass through, and compel
every sheep to walk in the solution slowly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>This treatment should be repeated once or twice a
week until the lameness has disappeared. In cases where
deep sloughing has taken place under the horny structures,
saturate a piece of oakum or cotton in the following
liniment: Oil of Origanum, Oil of Pisis, Oil of Turpentine,
each four ounces. Place it between the claws
and hold it there by means of a bandage. Repeat this
application every other day. The animals that do not
show signs of improvement under this treatment in a few
days invariably have the joints of the foot affected and
should not be driven.</p>

<h3>FORAGE POISONING.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—This condition is produced by animals eating
various foliage (Grass or Shrubbery) at a time when
the peculiar poisonous principles are developed in it, as
appears to happen in certain seasons. The disease is
liable to affect a large proportion of animals which are
under the same grazing conditions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Generally takes two or three days to
develop. The animal gradually becomes more or less
unconscious and paralyzed, staggers when forced to
walk, and it may have great difficulty in keeping on its
feet, it is extremely averse to going down, and leans for
support against any convenient object. It breathes in a
snorting manner. The mucous membranes are tinged
with yellow, and the bowels constipated. In other cases
severe diarrhoea follows, and the animal becomes very
weak and dies in convulsions or spasms. Recovery may
be expected in cases that are not marked by severe
symptoms.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Endeavor to find out the true cause
and remove it if possible. Change range or pasture for
a short time; this has successfully eradicated this malady.
The animal showing the above symptoms should
receive four to eight ounces of Castor Oil regardless of
whether there is diarrhoea or constipation. In either case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
the irritation will be relieved by its laxative effect. In
cases where diarrhoea becomes chronic, after administering
the Castor Oil, the following will be found very efficient
in its control: Protan, three ounces; Ginger, one
ounce; Gum Catechu, two ounces. Make into sixteen
powders and place one powder well back on the tongue
every four or six hours. Feed clean, wholesome food and
supply clean, fresh water to drink. Provide shelter for
the animal if the weather is hot.</p>

<h3>GARGET.<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Congestion and Inflammation of the Udder</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—As a rule, in Garget or Congestion of the
Udder in heavy milking ewes, just before and after
lambing, the glands of the udder enlarge, become hot,
tense and tender and a slight pasty swelling extends
forward from the glands on the lower surface of the abdomen.
This physiological condition is looked upon as
a matter of course and disposed of in two or three days
when the secretions of milk have been fully established.
General breaking up of the udder may be greatly hastened
by the sucking of a hungry lamb and the kneading
it gives the udder with its nose is beneficial. The above
mentioned congestion or Garget may emerge into active
inflammation resulting from continued exposure to cold
weather, standing in cold drafts or injury to the udder
from stone, clubs, feet of other animals, overfeeding or
rich food, like cotton seed or soy bean, sore teats or a ewe
losing her lamb in the period of full milking; serious disturbances
of the animal’s health is liable to fall upon the
udder.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—The symptoms and mode of attack
vary in different cases. Following exposure to cold
drafts or cold, wet weather, there is usually severe chilling
with cold ears and limbs and general dryness and
brittleness of the wool. This is followed by a flush of
heat, the ears and limbs become unnaturally warm and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
the glands swell up and become firm and solid in one or
both sides of the udder. The muzzle is hot and dry, temperature
elevated two or three degrees above normal,
pulse firm and quick, excited breathing, appetite and
rumination suspended, bowels constipated, urine scanty
and the yield of milk may be entirely suppressed in the
affected side.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Determine the cause and remove it if
possible. Move the affected animals to comfortable
quarters, supply liberal quantities of bedding for the
animal to lie upon. Give two to six ounces of Glauber
Salts dissolved in a pint of hot water. Permit it to cool.
Place the ewe on her haunches and drench carefully.
Feed laxative foods as hot bran mashes, steamed rolled
oats and vegetables, supplying the animal with pure
water to drink, to which add two drams of Hyposulphite
of Soda, two or three times a day. In some cases it is
advisable to apply Camphorated Ointment to the udder
once or twice a day.</p>

<h3>GID.<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Sturdy</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Gid is produced by a bladder worm, a larva
or an egg of the tapeworm infesting the intestines of
dogs, wolves and coyotes. The eggs of these tapeworms
are scattered over the range or pastures in the droppings
of infested dogs, wolves or coyotes, and these when
swallowed in the food or water by the sheep, hatch out
and the embryos migrate to the brain, spinal cord, etc.,
where they develop into cysts, bladder worms or water
bags, etc. When the organs of sheep, thus infested, are
eaten by dogs, wolves or coyotes, the cyst worms are
also likely to be swallowed and then develop into mature
tapeworms.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—In case a large number of embryos become
lodged in the brain of sheep, the first signs will be
shown in about eight to twelve days. Bladder worms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
produce a congestion of the brain which causes dullness,
dizziness, indicating an affection of the brain, walking or
turning in circles. If the left side of the brain is affected,
they will turn to the left; if the right side is affected,
they will turn to the right. The head eventually
droops, the eyes become red and the vision is impaired,
the head very hot over the affected region, the affected
sheep become separated from the flock. Sometimes the
sheep are partially or completely paralyzed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prevention.</span>—Prevention is the only method by
which this disease can be eradicated. Prevent the sheep
from becoming infected with these parasites. Stray
dogs, wolves or coyotes should be killed whenever found,
and dogs too valuable to kill should be kept free from
tapeworm. Meat should not be fed to dogs unless cooked
or known to be free from tapeworm cysts.</p>

<h3>GRUBS IN THE HEAD.<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Head Maggot</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Grubs in the head of sheep are produced by
the Sheep Gadfly which is yellowish-gray in color with
five well divided rings around its body, covered over with
fine hair and the lower portion of the head white. This
fly is somewhat larger than the ordinary house fly. It
attacks sheep and goats during the Summer and Fall
and deposits its larva about the sheep’s and goat’s nostrils.
This larva attaches itself to the mucous membrane
of the nostrils with two hooklets by which it gradually
works into the air cavities of the head, remaining
there for about ten months. Then it again passes from
the nostrils, burrows into the ground and becomes a
fully matured Gadfly in six or eight weeks, which completes
its life cycle, the head of the sheep or goat being
its intermediate host where the newly born Gadfly again
attaches its larva.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—When sheep or goats are attacked by
this Gadfly, they run, strike at the nose with their front<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
feet, rub the nose on the ground or against other sheep.
In case only three or four larvae gain entrance to the
sinuses of the head, they produce very little, if any, ill
effects, but where they become numerous, they cause the
animal to cough and sneeze continually, discharge from
the nose, which is occasionally tinged with blood. The
appetite becomes impaired, the animal shows signs of
emaciation, becomes very weak, raises the nose in the
air, but eventually becomes so weak it reels when walking
and finally lies down. It becomes so weak it cannot
toss the head or rise, and dies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prevention Treatment.</span>—Very successful. Paint
the sheep’s or goat’s nose with Pine Tar, or better still,
place salt in a trough, covering it with boards, with holes
bored in them just large enough for the animal to insert
its nose. Smear Pine Tar about the holes once or twice
a week. This treatment has proven very efficient in localities
where sheep Gadflies are numerous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Medical Treatment.</span>—After the animal once becomes
infected with these grubs, bore holes (trephine)
through the skull with a sharp instrument made for this
purpose and remove the grubs.</p>

<h3>HOVEN.<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Bloating—Acute Tympanites—Acute Indigestion</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Hoven is caused by various kinds of food
which produce indigestion or fermentation and resultant
gases in the rumen or paunch. When sheep are first
turned into young clover, they eat so greedily of it that
bloating frequently results. Turnips, potatoes and cabbage
may also produce it. Middlings and corn meal also
frequently give rise to it. In this connection it may be
stated that an excessive quantity of any food, before
mentioned, may bring on this disorder, or it may not be
due to excessive eating but to eating too fast. Sometimes
the quality of food is at fault. Grass, clover or
alfalfa, when wet with dew or rain soaked, frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
produce digestive disorders and bloating follows. Frozen
roots or potatoes covered with white frost should be regarded
as dangerous. When food has been eaten too
hastily or when it is cold and wet, the digestive process
is imperfectly performed and the food contained in the
paunch ferments, during which process large quantities
of gas are formed. This same result may follow when a
sheep is choking, as the obstruction in the gullet prevents
the eructation or passing of gas from the stomach so that
the gas continues to accumulate until severe bloating
results.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—The swelling of the left flank is very
characteristic, as in well marked cases the flank at its
upper part rises above the level of the backbone and when
struck with the tips of the fingers emits a drum-like
sound. The animal has an anxious expression, moves
uneasily and is evidently distressed. If relief is not
obtained in time the sheep breathes with difficulty, reels
in walking or standing and in a short time falls down and
dies from suffocation. The distention of the stomach
or rumen may become so great that it pushes the diaphragm
(the membrane separating the lung and intestinal
cavity) forward against the lungs, so as to squeeze
and stop their movements, thus preventing the animal
from breathing and in some instances the case may be
complicated by a rupture of the stomach.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Do not waste any time. Puncture
about three inches downward and forward from the point
of the hip bone with a clean sharp knife, or any instrument
that is clean and sharp. A special instrument made
for this purpose, the trocar, is a very useful instrument.</p>

<p>Sometimes bloating becomes chronic, and if such is
the case dissolve two teaspoonfuls of Turpentine in one-half
pint of milk and drench the animal very carefully,
as some of this drench may escape into the lungs and
produce fatal pneumonia. Set a sheep upon its haunches
to give the medicine; if it coughs let it down quickly to
prevent strangulation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<h3>INDIGESTION.<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Dyspepsia</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Irritant food, damaged food, overloaded
paunch or sudden change of diet may produce this disease.
Want of exercise predisposes an animal to it and
it is caused by woody or indigestible food. Food which
possesses astringent (drying) properties tends to check
the digestive secretions and may also act as an exciting
cause. Food in excessive quantity may lead to disorders
of the digestion and to this disease. It is very likely to
appear towards the end of the protracted season of
drought, therefore a deficiency of water must be regarded
as one of the conditions which favors its development.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Appetite diminished; rumination, or
chewing the cud, irregular; tongue coated, mouth slimy,
feces passed apparently not well digested and offensive
in odor, dullness and fullness of the flanks. This disease
may, in some cases, assume a chronic character, for in
addition to the above mentioned symptoms, slight bloating
of the left flank may be observed. The animal
breathes with great difficulty and grunts with each respiration.
The ears and legs alternately become hot and
cold. The rumination, or cud chewing, at this stage
ceases and the usual rumbling sound in the stomach is not
audible. The passage of feces is entirely suspended and
the animal passes only a little mucus occasionally. Sometimes
constipation and diarrhoea alternate; there is a
rise in temperature in many cases. The disease continues
for a few days or a week in this mild form, while
the severe form of the disease may last for several weeks.
In the severe form the emaciation and loss of strength
may be very great. There is no appetite, no rumination or
rumbling sound in the stomach or intestines. The mouth
is hot and sticky, the eyes have retracted in their sockets
and the milk secretion has ceased. In such cases the
outlook for recovery is unfavorable. The affected animals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
fall away in flesh and become very weak, which is
shown by the fact that one finds the animal lying down.</p>

<p>On examination of sheep or goats which have died of
this disease, it is found that the lining membranes of the
fourth stomach and intestines, particularly the small
intestines, are red, swollen, streaked with deep red or
blushed lines or spotted. The lining of the third stomach
is more or less softened and may be easily peeled off.
The third stomach contains dry, hard food masses, closely
adhering to its walls. In some cases the brain appears to
become affected, probably from the pain endured and
weakness and absorption of poisons generated in the
digestive canal. In such cases there is weakness and a
staggering gait; the sheep or goats do not appear to see,
and will consequently run against obstacles. After a
time it falls down and gives up to a violent disordered
struggle. This delirious condition is succeeded by stupor
and death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Successful, if fed in its first stages on
small quantities of roots, sweet silage or select grasses
or hay. This should be offered several times daily. Very
little food should be allowed if the animal is constipated,
in which case give two to four ounces of Glauber Salts
dissolved in a pint of hot water. When it cools, set the
animal on its haunches and pour slowly and carefully.
If they strangle or cough let them down, as some of the
drench may escape into the lungs and produce lung complications.
After the Glauber Salts have acted and if
there is a lack of appetite and the animal does not chew
the cud regularly, the following tonic will be found beneficial:
Pulv. Gentian Root, one ounce; Pulv. Nux Vomica,
one ounce; Pulv. Anise Seed, two ounces. Mix thoroughly
and make into thirty-two powders. Give one
powder two or three times a day well back on the tongue.
The food must be rather laxative and of a digestible
character. After an attack of this form of indigestion,
ice cold water should be avoided. Food should be given
in moderate quantities, as any excess by overtaxing the
digestive functions may bring on a relapse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<h3>JAUNDICE.<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Liver Congestion—Inflammation of the Liver</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Jaundice or Liver Congestion is due to constipation
where there is an inactive or torpid condition
of the bowels and the bile which passes into the intestines
is absorbed and produces a yellow staining of
Jaundice. Jaundice is merely a symptom of a disease
and ought to direct attention to ascertain if possible the
cause or causes which give rise to it. Inflammation of
the liver usually occurs as a complication of infectious
diseases. It may also occur as a complication of intestinal
catarrh, or in hot weather from overheating, eating
decomposed or irritating food or from drinking stagnant
water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—The signs are sometimes obscure and
their real significance is frequently overlooked. The most
prominent symptoms are the yellowness of the white of
the eyes and of the mucous membranes lining the mouth,
appetite poor, body presents an emaciated appearance,
the feces is light in color, while the urine is likely to be
unusually dark and there is great thirst present. The
gait is weak and the animal lies down more than usual
and while doing so frequently has its head around resting
on the side of its chest. Temperature is slightly elevated
above normal and breathing is somewhat hurried.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Remove the cause if possible. Give
Glauber Salts in three to four ounce doses, diluted in a
pint of hot water permitted to cool and give at one dose.
When drenching, be very careful, as some of the liquid
may escape into the lungs and produce severe complications.
Feed green food or hot bran mashes and supply
them with a liberal quantity of pure water to drink.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<h3>LIVER FLUKE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—The parasite that produces Liver Fluke in
sheep has an oblong, flat, leaf-like body, brownish in
color, measuring from one-fourth to one-half inch in
length. Sheep become infected with this Liver Fluke
from grazing on low marshy pastures infected by the
larvae of Liver Fluke.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—A sheep, when first infected with Liver
Fluke, generally thrives as the parasites tend to stimulate
the process of digestion, being located as they are in
the liver, but eventually rumination becomes irregular,
the sheep becomes anemic, weak and the visible mucous
membranes of the mouth, nose and eyes become pale,
bloodless, taking on a yellowish color as the disease progresses.
Swellings will also appear under the jaw along
the neck and under the lung cavity. The process of
breathing becomes feeble and temperature irregular.
Pregnant ewes will generally abort and nursing ewes’
milk will become so deprived of its nourishing properties
that the lambs become emaciated, although not necessarily
affected with the Liver Fluke.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prevention.</span>—Move to non-infected pastures, supply
the animals grazing on low marshy pastures with a
liberal amount of salt, also introduce frogs, toads, carp,
etc., into the marshy ponds, as they destroy the parasite
in its first stages of development, feeding on their intermediate
host, the snail.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Medical Treatment.</span>—This is of little value. After
an animal once becomes infected with the parasite, it
never makes a complete recovery, although Calomel administered
in ten grain doses every two or three weeks
appears to have a very good effect in some cases, if fed
freely on nitrogenous food and permitted to drink well
of pure running water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<h3>LUNG FEVER.<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Pneumonia—Congestion of the Lungs—Pulmonary Apoplexy</i>)</span></h3>

<p>Acute congestion and inflammation of the spongy tissues
of the lungs is frequently seen in sheep, the same as
in other animals.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Sheep that are overdriven are subject to
Lung Congestion in acute or chronic form and sometimes
Pulmonary Apoplexy, and especially when in a plethoric
condition are predisposed to inflammation of the lungs.
The exciting cause is very much the same as in different
diseases of the air passage and it is not uncommon for
the inflammation to extend from these parts of the lungs.
However, there are a number of causes in addition to
those already mentioned. It frequently results when
sheep are accustomed to warm, comfortable quarters and
are changed to cold, drafty pens, or shipping some distance
in open stock cars during cold weather. In fact,
any sudden chilling of the body is a common cause of
lung disorders. Giving fat sheep too much exercise when
they are not accustomed to it is a very frequent cause of
Congestion and Inflammation of the Lungs. This may
occur when they are chased by dogs, etc., or when driven
to a distant market at too rapid a gait. Exercise during
the hot summer months is apt to cause congestion of the
lung substance, as well as heat stroke. Dipping sheep
during cold weather may chill the body and result in
this disease.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—If due to severe exercise, the animal appears
greatly exhausted and the Congestion of the Lungs
is marked. Death may occur at this stage of the disease.
Inflammation of the Lungs usually begins with a chill
and is followed by a high fever. The sheep stand most
of the time and may eat nothing, or very little. The
breathing is hurried at first, but when the lungs become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
badly involved, it is also labored. The character of the
pulse beat varies, depending on the extent of the inflammation
and the stage of the disease. In most cases
the pulse is full and quick during the early stages of the
disease. A very weak pulse is present in severe and
fatal cases of Pneumonia. The visible mucous membranes
have a red colored appearance and there may be a
slight discharge from the nostrils. The expression of
the face is anxious and distressed in severe cases and
rigors and chilling of the body occur. The respiratory
sounds are more or less normal. The cough at first is
deep and dry; later it becomes loose and moist. It may
be accompanied by a hemorrhage during this stage of the
disease. Other respiratory sounds are revealed by placing
the ear to the side of the chest walls and listening to
the sound of the lungs. This cannot be practiced in long
wooled sheep with satisfaction, as the chest walls are so
thick that the lung sounds are deadened, or the noise
made by the animal hides the respiratory murmurs in
the very early stages of Inflammation of the Lungs. A
crepitating or crackling sound can be heard in the diseased
parts and louder sounds than normal in the healthy
areas. Later when the engorgement of the lung substance
occurs and the air cells become filled with an inflammatory
serum, the respiratory sounds are deadened,
but on returning to the normal, a rattling sound occurs.
These symptoms help greatly in determining the animal’s
condition and in watching the progress of the disease.
The chances for the recovery depend on the extent
and the acuteness of the inflammation. Careless handling,
exercising, etc., lessen the chances for a favorable
termination in the disease, but good care helps more to
bring about recovery than the medical treatment. The
recovery is more unfavorable in fat than in lean sheep, as
the inflammation is usually more severe in the former.
The course is from seven to twenty-one days and it may
become chronic if the irritation is kept up. In such cases,
unthriftiness is a prominent sign.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—The preventive treatment in Pneumonia
must not be overlooked. Briefly, it consists in
avoiding such conditions as may predispose the animal to
the disease or act in any way as an exciting cause. Careful
nursing is a very important part of the treatment.
The sheep should be given a comfortable, well ventilated
shed and kept as quiet as possible. If the bowels become
constipated, give two or three ounces of Castor Oil and
feed sloppy food. As one attack predisposes the sheep
to a second, it should be protected from severe cold, or
the other extreme, heat, for a month after making a
complete recovery.</p>

<p>The following prescription will be found very beneficial:
Iodide of Ammonia, one-half ounce; Chlorate of
Potassi, one ounce; Pulv. Nux Vomica, one ounce. Make
into twenty-four powders and give one powder every
four hours well back on the tongue. Continue this treatment
until the animal has recovered.</p>

<h3>LUNG WORMS, LAMB DISEASE.<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Verminous Bronchitis</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Due to a white thread-like worm (Strongylus
Filaria) varying in length from one to three inches.
The worms affect and live in the trachea (windpipe)
and bronchial tubes. Infected animals, in coughing, expel
fertilized eggs which develop on the grass and stagnant
water. The larvae are again taken up either in the
drinking water or in eating grass or hay gathered on
low marshy soil. Warm wet weather favors their development.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—This worm is liable to attack a number
of animals at the same time. The weakest sheep and
young lambs are the first to show signs by coughing
forcibly, distressing, hacking and convulsive in character.
A stringy mucus is sometimes expelled during the spasm
of coughing. This mucus contains worms which can be
detected, or their ova observed under a magnifying glass.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
In the latter stages of the disease, they cough severely
at night. These attacks have a sub-acute character and
prove very exhausting. The parasite by becoming entwined
in balls severely affects the animal’s breathing
which is always remarkably labored in the latter stages
of the disease. The animal refuses to eat, becomes emaciated,
anemic, mucous membranes of the eyes, mouth
and nose become very pale and the sheep die in convulsions
from suffocation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Preventive Treatment.</span>—Avoid grazing your
sheep on low marshy soil, especially during warm wet
weather. Young lambs and weak ones are especially susceptible
to this disease.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Medical Treatment.</span>—The writer has tried various
treatments as fumigation with different substances and
injection of remedies into the windpipe by the use of a
hypodermic syringe, etc., but none have proven very successful,
from a practical standpoint. I would recommend
placing the affected animals in a tightly closed barn
or shed, in the center of which place a pan of red hot coals
and cover with Sulphur.</p>

<p>A person should remain in the barn or shed as long as
he possibly can and after the fumes become so irritating
that he cannot endure them any longer, he should immediately
make his exit. The sheep should be compelled
to stay a minute or two longer and then quickly open
the doors and windows. Repeat this treatment once or
twice a week. Feed affected animals well. Give them
fresh water to drink and protect them from exposure.
This treatment, as above described, has given very good
results, providing the parasites were not too numerous.</p>

<h3>SCAB.<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Mange</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—The mange mite (Psoroptes Communis).
This parasite is equipped with stylets which pierce the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
skin at the seat where the mange mite penetrates the skin,
and produces small red spots followed by a blister filled
with serum, which ruptures, the serum drying and forming
a small scab. It is in this way that innumerable
mange mites cause the piling up of scabs thus producing
a very scaly condition. As Mange advances, the scaly
patches eventually pile up until they attain the thickness
of one-half inch, unless these scabs have been severely
rubbed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Very easily detected, as a bunch of
sheep that have been recently infected will be uneasy or
restless, rubbing against fences, posts, brush, etc., causing
bunches of wool to loosen. The itching seems to be
more intense at night and during warm weather. The
affected animals will even make attempts to bite themselves,
due to the agony produced by the mange mite.
If the skin is examined by the aid of a magnifying glass,
the mange mite can be easily noticed, or by scraping the
skin with a knife and placing the scabs on a dark paper
and exposed to the warmth of the sun, the mange mite
moving about can readily be seen with the naked eye.
Mangy sheep become very poor and eventually die.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prevention.</span>—This is important, for although the
disease is treated with very good results, the mange mite
annoy the sheep until they become very weak and emaciated
and the loss of wool is enormous due to the affected
animal continually rubbing against fences, brush, etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Consists of using various dips, as
Lime and Sulphur, which is recommended by the United
States Bureau of Animal Industry. This is very effective
and inexpensive. Scabby sheep should be dipped a
week or ten days after shearing; two dippings are necessary
at the interval of ten days. After dipping, move to
non-infected range or pastures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<h3>TICK.<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Louse Fly</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—The tick that infects sheep has a very small
head sunken into its round body. The head possesses a
flexible trunk or snout that penetrates the skin. Through
this trunk, the ticks derive their nourishment by sucking
the blood from the body of the sheep. The tick is also
provided with three pairs of legs. The female lays her
young in the form of a spun egg (cocoon) which is oblong
in shape and brown in color. This egg is cemented
to the wool of sheep where young ticks are hatched in
about four to six weeks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Long wooled sheep are more susceptible
to this tick as their wool provides shelter for both the
tick and its eggs. After shearing the sheep the ticks have
a tendency to leave the body and to migrate to the legs
or to unshorn lambs where their snouts or trunks pierce
the skin which appears to become infected, producing a
swelling and inflammation. The infected sheep run,
scratch and bite themselves. When these ticks become
developed in large quantities, they produce a paleness
of the mucous membranes of the eyes, mouth and nose,
as the ticks suck large quantities of blood, which produces
an anemic condition. The sheep become poor,
weak and unthrifty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Satisfactorily treated by dipping infected
sheep in Coal Tar dips or Emulsions of Crude
Petroleum. Shearing the sheep has a good effect, but
care must be exercised as the ticks then rapidly migrate
to the lambs.</p>

<h3>PREFACE</h3>

<p>This chapter, as its title indicates, is to give to the
Students and Veterinary Profession a general view of
the diseases of poultry, their causes, symptoms and
treatment in a condensed and yet in a complete form.</p>

<p>Thousands of dollars worth of poultry are lost each
year because of the veterinarians not having for immediate
reference a book giving full information regarding
the causes, symptoms, and treatment of diseases,
with reliable and authentic advice on what to do for
poultry that are sick or unthrifty.</p>

<p>If this brief chapter proves itself of value to our
students to which it is most fraternally dedicated, the
writer will feel himself amply repaid.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>AIR SAC MITE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Produced by a parasite called Cylodites
Nudus, which bears a close resemblance to the parasite
causing mange or scabies in the domesticated animal.
Owing to the peculiar construction of their breathing
organs fowls are more susceptible to parasites than
animals. In addition to effecting the lungs, the Air Sac
Mite may extend its operations to the intestines, kidneys,
liver and bones.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Unthriftiness is first noticed, but after
the parasites become numerous, the fowl shows signs of
difficult breathing, perhaps terminating in bronchial
pneumonia. In some cases death occurs without apparent
cause. The bird will be inactive, becomes separated
from the rest of the flock, comb pale, head drawn close
to the body, wings hang pendulous, lose flesh, breathing
becomes hard, coughing, sneezing and a rattling from
the mucus in the windpipe is heard. Death is produced
from suffocation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Separate the sick from the healthy
fowls. Disinfect coops and runways of both sick and
healthy birds with Crude Carbolic Acid, undiluted. Also
fumigate the fowls in their coops with steam from hot
water and Pine Tar. This may be done by placing the
water and Tar in a pan and then inserting a hot stone
or brick in the solution. This perhaps is the simplest
method of fumigation. Also mix Sulphur in their feed
regularly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<h3>APOPLEXY.<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Hemorrhage of the Brain</i>)</span></h3>

<p>Due to the rupture of a blood vessel of the brain and
pressure from the escaping blood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Mechanical injuries, straining when laying
eggs (hens are frequently found dead on the nest from
this cause), overfeeding, stimulating food, etc., all tend
to produce apoplexy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Appear very suddenly, bird is seen to
walk unsteadily, falls, or perhaps is found dead.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—In mild attacks, apply cold water or
ice to fowl’s head until thoroughly cooled. Give one-half
grain of Calomel, feed soft food, compel the bird to
exercise. Owing to the loss of blood a tonic will be necessary.
Pulv. Gentian Root, Pulv. Saltpeter, Capsicum
and Ferri Sulphate Pulv. equal parts one ounce. Mix
and place one teaspoonful in feed for every twenty-five
fowls. This tonic purifies and builds up the blood, just
what is needed in this particular condition.</p>

<h3>BALDNESS.<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Favus</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Due to fungi.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—The first noticeable sign is the whitish
appearance of the comb due to gray spots about the size
of a pin head. As the disease progresses, this condition
spreads to other parts of the body; the feathers look
rough and dry and break easily. The fowl grows weaker,
refuses to eat and if not properly treated, dies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Remove the scabs by separating the
feathers and using a brush. Apply Sulphur Ointment.
Repeat this treatment after two or three days. Great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
care must be taken to prevent the fowl from chilling or
taking cold.</p>

<h3>BEAK AND THROAT OBSTRUCTION.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Lodgment in the beak or food canal of a
foreign substance, such as a kernel of corn, sunflower
seed, bone, etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Fowl jerks its head suddenly and frequently
attempts to swallow. If a close examination is
made the foreign body can be felt from the outside.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—For the removal of such obstructions,
no special treatment is needed further than to use care
and avoid any injury to the beak or throat. Feed nutritious
food, as wheat bran mashes and vegetables and see
that they have a liberal quantity of good pure water at
all times.</p>

<h3>BLACKHEAD.<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Infectious Entero Hepatitis of Turkeys</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Due to a protozoa taken into the system
with the food or drinking water. This parasite enters the
caeca which becomes inflamed and discolored and the
liver is enlarged and studded with yellowish spots about
the size of a pea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Although this disease is termed Blackhead,
the discoloration of the head is not necessarily
present in all cases; neither is this condition confined to
this particular disease. One of the first symptoms is
loss of appetite, followed in most cases by diarrhoea.
The fowl becomes weak and loses weight rapidly. Examination
of the liver after death will determine whether
or not death has been caused by Infectious Entero Hepatitis.
The dead birds should be burned to prevent the
spread of the disease.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Prevention is one of the most important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
factors as this disease is very contagious and the protozoa
once implanted in the turkey runs is almost impossible
to eradicate. Provide clean, well ventilated
coops and feed clean, wholesome food and good fresh
water to drink.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Medical Treatment.</span>—Give Bismuth Salicylate
and Quinine Sulphate each one grain two to three times
a day. Also mix Hyposulphite of Soda in the proportion
of two to four grains to every fowl in their drinking
water twice daily. Disinfect coops and runs with Crude
Carbolic Acid, undiluted.</p>

<h3>BODY LICE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Insanitary conditions. Communicated by
direct contact.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Young chicks become emaciated and
die quickly. Older birds withstand the parasite much
longer, but in time show signs of uneasiness by dusting
themselves frequently. The comb and wattles become
pale and bloodless, the feathers rough, dry and brittle.
The birds grow weak, poor and eventually die.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Dust the birds with the following:
Sulphur, one part; Napthaline, one part; Tobacco Dust,
twenty-eight parts and seventy parts of middlings. Powder
finely and mix well together and dust the birds once
daily. Also sprinkle freely in the dust baths.</p>

<h3>BRONCHITIS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Exposure to dampness, cold drafts of air,
inhaling irritating gases, vapors or dust. The fowls
should be carefully examined, as bronchitis is occasionally
caused by the presence of gapeworms.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Loss of appetite, the bird moves about
slowly, breathing with difficulty and making a sort of
whistling sound accompanied by a cough. As the disease<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
progresses, there will be a peculiar bubbling sound from
breathing due to an excessive accumulation of mucus
in the windpipe. At this stage of the disease the bird
becomes very weak and if not properly treated and cared
for will rapidly lose strength, the feathers will become
rough, head and wings droop, and the bird dies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—This disease is most satisfactorily
treated by placing the affected birds in warm, dry, well
ventilated quarters, admitting sunlight if possible, but
excluding all drafts of air. Feed stale bread, middlings,
etc. Also place the fowls in a moderately air tight coop
and compel them to inhale steam from hot water and
Turpentine. This is readily done by placing the water
and Turpentine in a pan and then insert a hot stone or
brick in the solution. Force them to inhale this steam
from twenty to thirty minutes twice a day. Also add
Chlorate of Potash to their drinking water, one teaspoonful
to every twenty-five aged fowls. To chicks add one-fourth
teaspoonful to every twenty-five. If the weather
is favorable and the above treatment is followed, bronchitis
yields very favorably.</p>

<h3>BUMBLE FOOT.<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Corns—Deep Bruises—Abscesses</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Sharp-edged or narrow perches which
bruise the feet or where the perches are high, heavy fowls
often injure their feet by alighting on stones or other
hard objects.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—The bird limps or hobbles about, moving
with great difficulty. Examination will show the
foot to be hot and tender to the touch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Wash with clean, warm water and in
some cases it is advisable to apply Hot Flaxseed poultices.
When soft spots or abscesses develop, lance them
with a clean, sharp knife. After abscesses and bruises
are opened, treat them antiseptically by washing with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
solution of Carbolic Acid, one teaspoonful to a pint of
water. The foot should be bandaged to keep out dust
and dirt.</p>

<h3>CATARRH.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Exposure; poorly constructed coops which
admit rain or drafts. Weak birds are very susceptible
to Catarrh.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—The bird is dull, moves about slowly,
coughing or sneezing; appetite is poor, the mucous membrane
of the air passage becomes inflamed and the breathing
difficult, especially through the nose. The discharge
from the nostrils at first watery, becomes mucus-like and
thick and sticky, closing the nose, causing the bird to
breathe wholly through the mouth with a wheezing
sound.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—The cause of Catarrh shows the necessity
of clean and comfortable quarters for the fowls.
Keep the birds strong and vigorous by feeding clean,
nourishing food.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Medical Treatment.</span>—To each fowl administer in
their drinking water or feed: Chlorate of Potash, one
grain, twice daily.</p>

<h3>CHICKEN POX.<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Sore Head—Warts</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—These diseases are due to low forms of parasites
or fungi and occur most frequently in wet weather
especially if the coops are leaky and allow the rain to
fall on the droppings, causing mold or fungi. Poor ventilation
and lack of light also promotes the growth of
fungi.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—The disease is usually confined to the
head and affects principally young chickens, pigeons and
turkeys, but rarely ducks and geese. The infection appears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
in form of yellowish warts or nodules about the
nose, eyelids, comb, wattles, under the wings, or any unfeathered
place. The warts vary in size from that of a
pin head to the size of a pea and they discharge a fluid
which at first is thin and watery but as the disease progresses,
it becomes thick and sticky, yellow in color and
fetid in smell. At this stage the appetite is poor, the
feathers appear rough, and where the eyelids are affected,
as in most cases, the bird cannot see, fails to eat, becomes
emaciated, loses weight and strength rapidly and if not
properly treated, dies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—This disease is very contagious, therefore
the coops and runs should be disinfected with Crude
Carbolic Acid, undiluted. In the drinking water add
Hyposulphite of Soda in the proportion of one to two
grains to each fowl (one-half grain to chicks). Wash
the nodules or warts about the head with Carbolic Acid
solution, one teaspoonful to a quart of water. Feed
easily digested food, such as vegetables or warm bran
mashes.</p>

<h3>CONGESTION OF THE LIVER.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Lack of exercise, overfeeding, tainted or
moldy food, infection, or impure blood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Birds suffering from this disease seldom
show signs of sickness and it is well to dissect the
fowl after death to ascertain the exact cause. If death
is caused by Congestion of the Liver, the organ will be
greatly enlarged and easily torn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—If the fowls are fat and sluggish, compel
them to exercise by driving them about. Also give
fifteen to twenty grains of Epsom Salts to each affected
fowl. Feed laxative foods that are easily digested, as
vegetables and warm bran mashes. They are cooling
and relieve congestion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<h3>CONGESTION OF THE LUNGS.<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Pulmonary Congestion</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Exposure; the bird chills, causing contraction
of the blood vessels near the surface of the body,
thereby forcing a large quantity of blood to the internal
organs; the small blood vessels in the lungs become distended
with blood and rupture.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Rapid and difficult breathing; the bird
appears stupid and sleepy and does not care to move
about; appetite poor, wings drooping, plumage ruffled, a
thick mucus, colored with blood, escapes from the mouth,
comb and wattles show a dark-red color from lack of oxygen
in the blood. This disease is of very short duration,
the bird dying within a few hours. It is very common
among young chicks and turkeys that are permitted to
run out in the early spring rains.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Medical treatment is of no value, as
the disease progresses so rapidly that the bird dies shortly
after the first symptoms appear. Sanitary surroundings,
good light, pure air and exercise are essential. Do
not allow the birds to stand out in the cold or rains, especially
during the molting season. Keep your poultry
strong and vigorous by feeding clean, nourishing food
and give them pure water to drink.</p>

<h3>CONSTIPATION.<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Intestinal Obstruction</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Irritation of the membranes lining the intestines,
caused by dry feed, glass or gravel; may also be
due to parasitic worms. Obstruction may occur in any
part of the intestines although the external opening is
the part most frequently affected.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Bird appears dull and stupid, walks
with difficulty and attempts frequently to expel the obstructing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
material. The appetite is poor and the feathers
rough. By examination and manipulation the obstruction
may be located. Dried masses of excrement by adhering
to the feathers sometimes block the outer opening
of the intestines.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Remove the waste matter clinging to
the feathers with warm water or by clipping the feathers
off. If the Cloaca is obstructed, give injections of Sweet
Oil or Olive Oil with a small bulb syringe. Also give one
to two grains of Calomel and feed clean food and soft
mashes containing Pulv. Gentian Root, one grain to each
fowl twice daily. This stimulates the worm-like movement
of the bowels and assists in expelling their contents.</p>

<h3>CROP IMPACTION.<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Obstruction, Paralysis, Inflammation, Catarrh</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Errors in feeding; birds that are not fed
regularly are predisposed to any of the above conditions;
may also be due to swallowing large pieces of bone,
thread, nails, pins, glass, gravel, etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Loss of appetite, frequent attempts to
swallow, crop greatly distended and hard on pressure;
eventually the food decomposes and a liquid may escape
from the mouth and nose. The bird appears dull, stupid
and sleepy, comb pale, feathers rough, beak open, owing
to pressure on the windpipe. If caused by swallowing
sharp objects, they may penetrate the crop and skin,
causing a gangrenous condition. Grain in the crop will
sometimes send out sprouts of considerable lengths.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—If no sharp objects are present, give
two teaspoonfuls of Sweet or Olive Oil. This will lubricate
the esophagus and crop. Manipulate the crop upward,
forcing the food gently through the mouth, adding
oil occasionally. If, however, sharp objects penetrate
the crop it is best to remove them through an artificial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
opening. Clip the feathers from around the intended
seat of operation and wash the clipped surface with a
Carbolic Solution, one teaspoonful to a pint of water.
The incision should not be over one-half inch long and
should be made as high as possible and in the center of
the crop. After removing the contents, sew up with
ordinary thread and needle and wash occasionally with
the above antiseptic solution. The operation is not difficult
and will be successful if the parts are not too badly
inflamed.</p>

<p>After-treatment consists of feeding very little food
until the crop is fairly well healed. Feed soft bran
mashes and vegetables. To the drinking water add Boracic
Acid, one grain, twice daily. It relieves the catarrhal
condition that is present, such as irritations of the
crop and intestines.</p>

<h3>DIARRHOEA.<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Gastro-Intestinal Catarrh—Enteritis</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Inflammation of the digestive organs can
be traced in every instance to the quality or quantity of
food and water consumed. The food or water may contain
parasites, or large quantities of mustard, pepper, or
may be moldy or tainted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Loss of appetite, the feathers appear
rough, the crop is sometimes paralyzed and distended
with gas, the bird moves slowly, the droppings vary in
color from a white to a yellow or a green and finally becomes
tinged with blood; at this stage there is a rise in
temperature accompanied by great thirst and signs of
pain. Mild cases of simple diarrhoea if not properly
treated when first symptoms appear, will develop the
same severe conditions described above.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Determine the cause and remove it if
possible. See that the food is clean and nutritious, the
coops well ventilated, the runs well lighted. Sunlight
is very beneficial. Avoid exposures, drafts and dampness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Place oatmeal in their drinking water, also give
two grains of Bismuth mixed with dough and make into
a small pill. Give one every six hours.</p>

<p>When in addition to the above symptoms a bloody
discharge is present, give six drops of Tincture of Catechu
every four hours. Warm mashes made of bran or
oatmeal are very nourishing and soothing to the intestinal
canal.</p>

<h3>DIPHTHERETIC ROUP.<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Diphtheria</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Due to a specific germ. The disease is very
contagious and is communicated by direct contact. Great
care should be exercised, therefore, when showing or
buying birds. Any new birds to be added to the flock
should be kept in separate pens for a week or two to
make sure they are in good condition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—The first symptoms are similar to those
of catarrh or cold. A clear, watery liquid escapes from
the eyes and nostrils, the head is drawn in toward the
body, the feathers appear rough, the breathing fast, the
temperature rises from three to five degrees above normal.
The bird walks about as if blind, sneezing, swallowing
with difficulty, and showing signs of great weakness.
If the mouth is open small white spots or elevations
will be seen on the back of the tongue. There
may be diarrhoea of a green or yellow color. As the disease
progresses the discharge from the nose and eyes
becomes thick and stringy, obstructing the air passages
and gathering in large quantities between the eyelids.
The mouth, throat and tongue are very much inflamed
and swollen and in most cases it is impossible for the
bird to make a sound. Recovery is doubtful after the
disease has reached this stage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Isolate the affected birds in some
clean, warm, light, well ventilated quarters, excluding
drafts. Dissolve thirty grains of Chlorate of Potash in
one ounce of water and one ounce of Glycerine, and to
the average sized fowl give one teaspoonful three or four
times a day. To chicks give one-fourth the dose. When
the scum loosens in the back part of the tongue, remove
gently. Care should be taken so as to prevent bleeding.
Feed soft, nourishing food.</p>

<h3>DOUBLE-YOLK EGGS.</h3>

<p>Eggs are frequently found with two yolks. This
condition is produced by two ovary capsules bursting at
about the same time and gaining entrance together into
the oviduct where they are concealed in the same shell.
Double-yolked eggs are larger than normal and may injure
the oviduct when expelled. When hatched they
produce twins or abnormal chicks.</p>

<h3>DROPSY.<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Ascites</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Generally due to irritating, indigestible
food, causing inflammation of the membraneous lining
of the intestinal cavity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—The abdomen becomes enlarged, is tender
to the touch and contains a watery fluid, the movement
of which can be heard in most cases by pressure on
the swollen parts. The bird appears stupid, the comb
pale and the appetite poor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Unless the bird is very valuable, treatment
is not advisable. In case the bird is valuable, give
one grain of Potassium Iodide twice daily in the feed or
drinking water. Also feed nourishing food as beef-scraps,
vegetables, wheat bran mashes, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<h3>EGG BOUND.<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Difficult Laying; Obstruction of the Oviduct</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Due to the eggs being too large, the bird
too fat, or to the absence of the secretions lubricating the
oviduct.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—The first signs are scarcely noticeable
but soon the feathers appear rough, the bird becomes dull
and moves slowly, making frequent efforts to expel the
egg.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Remove the egg by injecting Sweet
Oil, assisting the bird with gentle pressure. In some
cases it is well to puncture the egg and collapse the shell.
If the bird is very fat, reduce by careful feeding. If the
bird is of normal size, the trouble is probably due to the
absence of lubricating secretions of the oviduct, in which
case the following tonic should be given: Pulv. Ferri
Sulphate, Pulv. Gentian Root, each one dram. Mix and
make into thirty powders. Give one powder two or three
times a day in their feed for a week or ten days.</p>

<h3>EGG EATING.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Is usually due to lack of shell-building material
in the food; in such case the shell of the egg is thin
and easily broken and the fowl craving the lime contained
in the egg shell, naturally contracts the habit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Supply ground bone and oyster
shells. Feed green food such as cabbage, kale, potatoes,
carrots, etc.</p>

<h3>EGGS WITHOUT SHELLS.<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Soft-Shelled Eggs</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Deficiency of shell material; or it is possible
that fright sometimes causes premature expulsion
of the eggs before the shell is formed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Feed ground bone, oyster shells. They
contain egg shell producing material. Perhaps the best
results are obtained when mixed with wheat bran. Also
feed vegetables such as cabbage, potatoes and carrots.</p>

<h3>FEATHER PULLING.<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Feather Eating</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Irritation of the skin due to lice, mites, or to
lack of exercise and improper food.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Feed meat, ground bones and vegetables.
Place the food where the fowls are compelled to
scratch and work to obtain it. Dust the fowls with Powdered
Aloes.</p>

<p>If due to lice, treat the same as recommended under
the heading of Lice.</p>

<h3>GAPES.<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Verminous Trachea Bronchitis</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—A red, parasitic worm, the male measuring
about one-fifth of an inch and the female one-half an
inch in length. Fowls become infected by eating worms
containing this parasite or its eggs, and by coming in
contact with other birds suffering from the disease.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—The most noticeable symptom is frequent
gaping; the Gapeworms attach themselves by their
mouths to the walls of the windpipe where they suck the
blood which nourishes them; they cause irritation and inflammation
of the windpipe, bronchial tubes and lungs;
breathing is difficult and the bird loses strength rapidly;
windpipe eventually becomes totally obstructed and the
bird dies from suffocation and exhaustion. Young, weak
chickens are more susceptible to this disease than strong
ones.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Separate the sick birds from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
healthy ones. Clean and disinfect the coops and runs.
Burn all manure. Remove the worms from the windpipe
by the use of a feather, from which the fan has been
stripped, leaving only a small brush at the end. Dip the
feather into Oil of Turpentine or Coal Oil, removing the
surplus liquid by drawing the feather between the fingers.
Now insert the feather into the windpipe of the
bird and by turning gently you will dislodge the worms
from their attachments. Repeat this treatment once a
day for two or three days. Disinfect coops and runs
with undiluted Crude Carbolic Acid. Feed good nutritious
food as wheat bran mashes, etc.</p>

<h3>HEAD LICE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Result of insanitary conditions and lack of
care. Communicated by direct contact with infected
birds, or by infected coops or brooders.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—The head soon becomes denuded of
feathers, and also sore by being constantly scratched
with the feet. If not properly treated the chicks weaken
and die.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—An ointment made of one part Sulphur
and four parts Lard well mixed and applied two to
three times will exterminate the lice. If the fowl is run
down in condition, feed good nutritious food as wheat
bran mashes.</p>

<h3>HOW TO FEED YOUNG POULTRY.</h3>

<p>Withhold all food for at least eighteen hours; then
feed stale bread moistened with boiled milk every three
hours. When they are three or four days old, feed
rolled oats, ground corn moistened with pure water,
finely chopped meat and boiled vegetables. Feed them
often and you will be well repaid by their rapid growth,
strength, and the low death rate. After they reach the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
age of one week or ten days, watch them closely and
regulate their feed to their apparent needs.</p>

<h3>INCOMPLETE EGG.<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Abortion</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Irritation of the oviduct; improper secretion
of albumen or internal egg-producing material.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Careful feeding will overcome this
condition. Warm wheat bran mashes, ground bone, beef
scraps, all tend to allay the irritations of the oviduct and
stimulate the secretions of albumen.</p>

<h3>JAUNDICE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Obstruction of the bile duct, due to rich,
nitrogenous food and insufficient exercise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Disease is not easily detected. The
yellow color of the wattles and comb is the first symptom;
the appetite is variable, the feathers appear rough
and dry, the head is retracted, and the bird finally dies
owing to the absorption of bile in the blood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Change food. Feed upon a vegetable
diet, also give one grain of Calomel, which is particularly
useful in a case of sluggish liver in poultry. Also give
one grain of Pulv. Gentian Root and one grain of Bicarbonate
of Soda, twice daily in feed.</p>

<h3>MANGE.<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Scabies of the Body</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Due to a parasite that resembles the mite.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—When the affected bird is closely examined
large quantities of scales or scabs are found in the
soft feathers. The appetite is poor; the bird walks slowly
about showing signs of uneasiness. If the disease is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
allowed to run its course, the bird grows weak and eventually
dies. The disease is easily transmitted from one
bird to another and should be treated without delay.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Disinfect roost, coops and pens with
undiluted Crude Carbolic Acid. Apply to the irritations
that present themselves on the body of the birds: Sulphur
Ointment twice a week and feed good nourishing
food as wheat bran mashes and vegetables.</p>

<h3>PIP.<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Inflammation of the Mouth</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Irritations, injuries, or micro-organisms. It
is sometimes caused by nothing more than a dry condition
of the mucous membrane due to the bird breathing
through the mouth when suffering from respiratory diseases.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Dryness of the mucous membrane of
the mouth; especially the part covering the tongue,
which becomes hard and ragged, forming rough edges
along its sides. These dried portions become loose and
partially detached from the tongue, interfering with its
movements and causing more or less pain and annoyance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Do not forcibly detach these pieces,
but assist nature to remove them. This can be accomplished
by mixing Glycerine and Water, equal parts, and
dropping into the mouth with an ordinary syringe or
dropper. It is advisable to add Boracic Acid, one teaspoonful
to every gallon of drinking water, which will
prevent the entrance of parasites into the blood.</p>

<h3>RED MITE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—These grow spontaneously in favorable surroundings,
as the interior of poultry houses and brooders
containing numerous cracks and crevices.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—This mite is a blood-sucker; irritates
the skin and sometimes causes sores to form on the body
of the chick. The birds grow stupid and weak and die
rapidly if not properly treated. Older fowls withstand
the irritation of mites much longer, but do not thrive, or
lay regularly, and will finally die if the insects become
too numerous. The insect may be transmitted to horses,
cattle, and even to man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Paint the roosts and spray the interior
of the coops and runs with Crude Carbolic Acid, undiluted,
being very careful that the solution reaches the
bottoms of the cracks and crevices. Also paint the interior
of brooders with the same solution.</p>

<h3>RHEUMATISM.<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Leg Weakness—Gout—Paralysis</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Damp coops and pens, lack of ventilation
and improper food.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Fowl refuses to stand or walk, and on
examination, the legs are found to be swollen and painful,
especially about the joints. In some cases suppuration
of the joints takes place and they become open running
sores. The bone finally becomes diseased and the
fowl dies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Preventive measures are first to be
considered. See that the coops and pens are clean and
dry. Avoid drafts. Feed vegetables, also wheat bran
mashes. Give internally Salicylic Acid, one-half grain,
twice daily. When the legs are swollen and sore apply
Zinc Ointment once or twice daily.</p>

<h3>SCALY LEG.<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Scabies</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Due to a mite that burrows under the scales
of the leg.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—White, scaly-looking scabs form about
the upper part of the foot. The feet and legs become
swollen and painful as the disease progresses and if not
checked will result in lameness, inflammation of the
joints, and the toes may slough off. Great care is necessary
as the disease is very easily transmitted from one
bird to another.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Use boiling water or Crude Carbolic
Acid, undiluted, on the perches. Wash the feet and legs
with warm water and soft soap. Dry well and apply
Carbolated Ointment. Repeat the above treatment
every other day for a week.</p>

<h3>SORE MOUTH.<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Aphtha; Thrush</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—A vegetable parasite called Oidium Albicans.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Inflammation of the mucous membrane
lining the mouth, throat, gullet and crop, which finally
terminates in white ulcerations. Other symptoms are
swelling of the head, poor appetite and a rapid loss in
weight and strength.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Isolate the sick from the healthy
fowls. Give as much sunlight as possible, feed nourishing
food, such as warm oatmeal mashes, kale, potatoes,
etc. Add one grain each of Chlorate of Potash and
Boracic Acid to a tablespoonful of water and give three
or four times a day or oftener if they will drink it. A
good disinfectant must be used to prevent the disease
from spreading and I would recommend the use of undiluted
Crude Carbolic Acid about the coops and poultry
runs.</p>

<h3>TUBERCULOSIS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—This dreaded disease is caused by the Bacillus
of Tuberculosis. Damp, ill-ventilated, and poorly-lighted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
coops are favorable to the development of the
disease.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Except in advanced stages, this disease
is not easily detected as it affects various organs, and
considerable experience in post-mortems and a skillful
use of the microscope is required to successfully diagnose
a case.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Preventive measures should be practiced
as the disease is incurable. Do not expose the
fowls to cold wet weather. See that the coops are well
ventilated and lighted and feed no contaminated food.</p>

<h3>VENT GLEET.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Constipation is perhaps the most common
cause, the hard droppings causing irritation of the vent
which is followed by inflammation and suppuration of
the membranes lining the rectum and oviduct.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Frequent straining due to irritation.
As the disease progresses a pus-like discharge is noticed.
The disease may extend into the rectum or oviduct. The
bird appears stupid, the plumage rough, the comb pale,
and if not properly treated, dies a lingering death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Preventive treatment is the best. Feed
green food occasionally and warm bran mashes. This
prevents constipation. When the bird strains frequently
and a discharge is present the following solution should
be injected: Sugar of Lead, two drams; Zinc Sulphate,
one dram. Mix with two quarts of water. Inject about
one ounce with a syringe twice daily until the discharge
has ceased.</p>

<h3>WHITE DIARRHOEA.<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Fowl Cholera</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Germ (Bacilli of Fowl Cholera) gaining
entrance to the body through the bowels, lungs or wounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
of the skin. Death results from toxic material produced
while the germs are multiplying.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—All poultry, cage or wild birds are subject
to this disease. The first symptoms are loss of appetite;
diarrhoea is present and the discharge is almost
white in color and tinged with transparent mucus. The
affected bird becomes separated from the flock, seems
weak and stupid and appears to be asleep; feathers are
rough, the wings droop and the head is drawn in toward
the body; crop is generally full, owing to improper digestion.
The comb is pale and bloodless, the temperature
raised from three to five degrees above normal and
the bird loses weight rapidly; it may die with convulsions
and cries, or without a sound or struggle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—To grown fowls, give Zinc Sulphocarbolates
in one-half grain doses three times a day in their
food or drinking water. To chicks, dissolve thirty grains
of Zinc Sulphocarbolates in two quarts of water. Saturate
feed, as stale bread, etc., and give three times a day.
Zinc Sulphocarbolates is an antiseptic especially prepared
for septic conditions of the intestines, and very
useful in treatment of White Diarrhoea and Fowl Cholera.
In severe cases of diarrhoea, give Bismuth Salicylate,
one grain, three times daily in feed or make into a
pill with dough. When the fowls will eat, feed them
clean, nitrogenous food that they can digest easily, as
oatmeal mashes. It is also necessary to give them pure
water to drink at all times. Disinfection of the premises
is another essential factor in the treatment of this disease,
and undiluted Crude Carbolic Acid is a disinfectant
that we can rely upon at all times.</p>

<p>I cannot recommend vaccination as the serum is very
difficult and expensive to produce and different breeds
of birds require varying doses, therefore, vaccinating
poultry for White Diarrhoea or Fowl Cholera is not attended
with any great degree of success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<h3>WORMS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Few fowls are entirely free from worms.
The soil over which the chicks are permitted to run may
be infected, or the food may contain the eggs or embryos
of worms.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—The presence of worms in fowls may
not be at once detected, since only a close observer would
notice them in the droppings. If the birds eat well but
remain poor, and the feathers appear rough and the
comb and wattles pale, there is reason to suspect the
existence of worms.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Preventive treatment is the best.
Sprinkle the runs and coops regularly with Crude Carbolic
Acid, undiluted. Give two drops of Turpentine in
twice this quantity of Sweet or Olive Oil. This dose
should be repeated in from six to eight days so as to insure
the expulsion of the newly hatched worms or those
that may have survived the first treatment.</p>

<h3>PREFACE</h3>

<p>In offering this chapter for the consideration of the
Students as well as to the Veterinary Profession and
others who are interested in the study of diseases of
the dog I feel it will suffice to say that I have endeavored
to the best of my ability to render the matter contained
in the following chapter of as great practical value as
possible, to present in the most plain and yet concise
manner the nature, causes, symptoms, treatment, and
prevention of each disease in the form in which it most
frequently occurs.</p>

<p>I wish to express a hope that this chapter will be
favorably received by all Students of Veterinary Science
and the Veterinary Profession.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>ABSCESSES OF THE EAR.<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Haematoma</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Irritations or injuries to the ear. Washing
dogs with irritating soap and not properly drying them
causes dogs to have an itchy sensation which they constantly
aggravate by scratching the ear with the paw
and shaking the head and flopping the ears violently,
resulting in this disease.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—The dog will be noticed carrying the
head to one side and shaking it frequently in a violent
manner. It will also scratch the ear with the paw involuntarily.
When the inner surface of the ear is carefully
examined it will be found extremely swollen and have an
abnormal appearance, will be stiff and extend out from
the head. Great heat and pain will be evinced when
pressure is applied. The puffy swelling inside the ear
will contain a serous fluid which is very offensive in odor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—With a clean, sharp knife open the
abscess and allow the bloody fluid to escape. Then dress
the wound twice a day with clean cotton and a solution
made from Tincture of Iodine, one dram, to one-half
ounce of water. To prevent the dog from scratching
and flopping the ears, which would cause further irritation,
bind the ears to the head by means of a bandage or
hood. Feed clean, wholesome, laxative food and compel
him to exercise, as good physical condition and clean surroundings
assist materially in healing wounds of the
flesh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<h3>APOPLEXY<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Congestion of the Brain</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Congestion or rupture of the blood vessels
of the brain, which causes a sudden arrest of sense and
motion, the dog lying as if in a deep sleep. It seldom
attacks young, but occurs frequently in fat dogs, especially
if aged and not accustomed to exercise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—They are very hard to detect, as the
dog generally becomes unconscious before any violent
symptoms are noticed, but there is generally unsteadiness
in the walk, dizziness, deafness, blindness, constipation,
etc., preceding an attack, but only a careful observer
will notice them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—As this is a very dangerous disease,
no time should be lost. The first thing is to relieve the
head from the accumulation of blood to prevent further
congestion and avoid inflammatory action. To accomplish
this place the head well up and apply cold to the
head by means of pounded ice in a cloth bag. Loosen
the collar around the neck and apply hot packs to the
feet to induce the flow of blood to the lower extremities.
Also give a physic consisting of one to two grains of
Calomel. After the dog recovers from the fit great care
will be required to prevent a second attack. The diet
should be light and nutritious. Always avoid feeding
too large a quantity at one time, to prevent overloading
of the stomach. Also avoid excitement or excessive
exercise on a hot day. A cathartic as Calomel should be
administered when a dog shows any signs of constipation.</p>

<h3>ASTHMA</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—In some instances I believe it is hereditary,
although in others no influence of this nature can be discovered.
This affection frequently follows organic diseases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
of the chest. The spasms of difficult breathing
may be directly due to irritants inspired into the lungs,
such as smoke, gas, or dust and cold air containing infectious
matter. Overfeeding frequently produces this
condition, as an abnormal distention of the stomach
presses against the lungs and causes them to become
inactive and spasmodic contraction of the muscular fibers
of the bronchial tubes follows. Dogs with narrow chest
cavities are predisposed to asthma, which condition is
hereditary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—This disease is attended with difficulty
of breathing and a sensation of constriction of the chest,
giving rise to wheezing, coughing and general nervousness.
The animal becomes emaciated, the hair has a
rough, faded appearance, although it will continue to eat
well. Constipation is generally associated with this disease.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Place the animal in clean, comfortable
surroundings, exercise carefully as violent exercise
would tend to aggravate the disease. Feed sparingly
on nitrogenous food that is easily digested; also administer
Fowler’s Solution of Arsenic, four drops, twice daily.
This can be placed on the food, as the dog will take it
readily. If the bowels are constipated, give one to two
tablespoonfuls of Castor Oil. Good care and careful
feeding play a very important part in the treatment of
asthma.</p>

<h3>BARRENNESS</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Either the extreme of overfeeding and insufficient
exercise or of overworking and insufficient
supply of food. Contraction of the neck of the womb or
atrophy of the ovaries may produce barrenness. There
are also other conditions that produce failure to breed,
such as inflammation or growths in the womb or ovaries,
leucorrhea, etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—If due to Leucorrhea there will be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
white, glary discharge from the vagina, which looks like
curdled milk. It sometimes accumulates in the uterus
and comes away in large quantities and there is a fetid
smell. The animal generally becomes debilitated. In
other cases, where there is a contraction of the womb or
atrophy of the ovaries, no abnormal conditions will be
noticed except that the animal fails to conceive when
bred.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Use both local and constitutional
treatment. Feed sparingly on nitrogenous food that
is easily digested. Allow to exercise moderately and
the bitch may become fertile, if no morbid conditions are
present. If the animal is constipated administer one to
two ounces of Castor Oil and if in a run-down, debilitated
condition give Pulv. Nux Vomica, Pulv. Ginger Root,
Pulv. Ferri Sulphate, each one dram. Make into thirty-two
capsules and give one capsule three times daily.</p>

<h3>BRONCHITIS</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Sudden change of temperature, etc., choking,
drenching, inhalations of irritating material as certain
vapors, dust, etc., containing infectious material;
accumulations of gas in the stomach containing particles
of food may be regurgitated up into the esophagus frequently
producing bronchitis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—The chief symptoms consist of fever,
hurried breathing with a sense of tightness about the
chest, but not always acute pain. The cough is severe
and dry at first, but later expectoration commences. The
discharge that is raised from the bronchial tubes at first
is a clear, thin mucus, but afterwards it becomes thicker,
more abundant and purulent. It is difficult for persons
not accustomed to examining the chest to always distinguish
the disease from pneumonia, if the case is one
of severity. In mild cases the symptoms need not
usually occasion much alarm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—This disease may be prevented frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
by giving five to ten grains of Dover’s Powder
as soon as it is discovered that the dog has taken a cold.
It is best given in the evening then placing the dog in a
warm bed; also give some warm stimulants to drink as
Tincture of Capsicum, five to fifteen drops in a teaspoonful
of luke warm water. In the morning, give one
to two grains of Calomel. If the above does not cut
the disease short, then keep the dog confined to warm
quarters and give inhalations of steam from hot water
and Turpentine. For the cough, which is usually troublesome,
give the following mixture: Potassium Chlorate,
one dram; Liquor Ammonia Acetate, three ounces;
Vini Ipecac, two drams; Tincture of Camph. Co., one-half
ounce; Aqua Chloroform, quantity sufficient to
make four ounces. Give one to two teaspoonfuls three
or four times daily. Also feed nutritious food that is
easily digested and permit the animal to have access to
pure cold water.</p>

<h3>BURNS AND SCALDS</h3>

<p>There is considerable difference in the extent of injury
from the burns produced by hot vapors, fluids, etc.
In some cases, which are only superficial, there will be
slight inflammation or redness produced, while in others
the burn may be of severity and cause the death of the
skin, followed by sloughing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—For Burns and Scalds of ordinary
severity, I have derived excellent results from equal
parts of Raw Linseed Oil and Lime Water, as it removes
the soreness and restores the part to its normal
condition. In cases where the skin is sloughed off, in addition
to the above recommended, dust with Boracic
Acid, two ounces; Corn Starch, two ounces; Tannic
Acid, one-half ounce; Iodoform, two drams. Mix and
powder finely. Place in sifter top can and apply two
or three times daily to the moist, sloughing surface.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<h3>CANKER OF THE EAR</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Filth and dust, especially in long-eared
hunting dogs, as the inner surface of the ear becomes
dirty and damp from wading streams and running
through tall, wet grass. This condition is not serious
at first, but it will irritate the dog so as to cause him to
shake his head and scratch the ear with his paw. Permit
no filth to enter the ear as this will assist to develop a
Canker, which becomes very painful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—The dog shakes the head violently and
scratches the ears with the paw and even howls from the
severe pain produced. The ears will be moist and have
a poked-out appearance, due to the swelling. As the
disease progresses, there will be a very disagreeable discharge
from the ear that can be very easily detected some
distance from the animal. Ulceration eventually follows,
affecting the internal structure of the ear, which
condition is very difficult to treat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Remove the cause, if possible. Then
inject ten to fifteen drops of the following solution:
Mild Chloride of Mercury, fifteen grains; Lime Water,
four ounces. Shake well and apply to the ear as above
mentioned two to three times a day. Place a small
piece of cotton in the ear after each injection. Also
place a hood over the ears or bandage them down with
a cloth.</p>

<h3>CATARRH<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Cold in the Head</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—The most common, perhaps, is exposure,
especially after a dog has been used to warm closed
quarters. Dogs used for hunting purposes, when in a
poor condition, with their system weakened, are often
victims of Catarrh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Slight dullness. May not take food
very well, hair standing to some extent, pulse not much
affected, throat becomes sore. After the congestion
passes off, exudation takes place, followed by discharge
and it may be very profuse, but it need not alarm you.
There is generally impaired secretion of urine, but
breathing not much affected in most cases. We also
have a discharge from the nose in other diseases, such
as Distemper, Bronchitis, Pneumonia, etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—The treatment should be constitutional
as well as local. Place the animal in clean, well-ventilated
quarters; feed good nourishing food, which is
quite important. The following prescription is very
beneficial in suppressing the secretion from the nostrils:
Ferri Hypophosphitis, five grains; Quinine Sulphate,
three grains; Pulv. Nux Vomica, two drams; Arsenous
Acid, one-half grain. Make into twelve capsules and
give one capsule two or three times a day. Give inhalations
of steam from hot water and Oil of Eucalyptus for
one-half hour twice daily. Permit the dog to exercise
if the weather is favorable. If constipated give rectal
injections and feed laxative food. Avoid giving physics
in Catarrh, especially if there is fever present.</p>

<h3>CHOREA<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>St. Vitus Dance</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Due to an irritation of the nervous system.
It is especially associated with debility, although it may
follow constitutional diseases, such as Distemper, etc.
It is sometimes caused by a direct injury to the brain
or spinal cord.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—A continuous twitching of the muscles
which is noticeable even though the animal sleeps. The
muscles of the head may be affected, or those of one or
both fore limbs or of a hind limb. An animal affected
with Chorea will show an unsteady gait when walking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
and usually becomes very poor, although it will have a
very good appetite at all times.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—In severe cases the dog will not, as a
rule, respond to treatment. In milder cases, if taken in
hand early, improvement may be brought about, but
seldom a complete recovery. Many drugs have been
tried in the treatment of Chorea, but the superiority of
one medicine over another has not been practically demonstrated.
Fowler’s Solution of Arsenic given in from
two to eight drop doses has been tried in a large number
of cases and in my experience it has given the best results.
The drug should be given at first in small doses
and gradually increased as tolerance is established. If
the physiological action of the Arsenic becomes manifested
it should be discontinued for a few days. In
severe cases, Sedatives are indicated. Of these, either
Bromide of Potassi or Sodii should be given in ten to
twenty grain doses, prepared in gelatin capsules and
administered three or four times a day. Attention to
the digestive organs and to the diet is necessary during
the treatment. If the dog is constipated one or two
tablespoonfuls of Castor Oil should be administered.
Feed nitrogenous food that is easily digested and provide
comfortable sleeping quarters.</p>

<h3>COLIC</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Worms, indigestible or decomposed irritating
food, compaction or obstruction, calculus, strictures
of the intestines or it may be due to liver complication
and animals swallowing sharp bones, etc. Several forms
of poisoning may produce Colic.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—The dog evinces severe abdominal pain,
usually with constipation and often vomiting. As a
rule, there is no fever or quickness of the pulse. The
pain, which is spasmodic, is relieved on pressure as the
dog prefers to lie on his abdomen in many instances.
The dog frequently eats green grass as this causes him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
to vomit, which is nature’s method of relieving the digestive
tract of irritating material.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—In cases which are not very severe,
the application of hot cloths to the abdomen frequently
affords relief. Ginger, ten to twenty grains, dissolved
in a teaspoonful of water may relieve a mild attack, but
when the above treatment fails the following is recommended:
Fluid Extract of Cannabis Indica, one dram;
Chloroform, one dram; Tincture of Capsicum, ten
drops; Oil of Peppermint, ten drops; Morphine, three
grains; water, quantity sufficient to make one fluid
ounce. Give ten to fifteen drops every hour, if necessary.
A physic is indicated in the majority of cases of
Colic for the purpose of removing irritants or obstructions
from the intestines. Calomel, one to two grains,
is a very efficient drug, while Castor Oil is given with
great difficulty and it should be administered only where
diarrhoea is a complication of Colic. Rectal injections
of warm water is very beneficial in the treatment of intestinal
obstructions. It is good practice to give a dog
some vermifuge after an attack of Colic, as worms frequently
produce it.</p>

<h3>CONSTIPATION</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Insufficient exercise, overfeeding or feeding
decomposed or irritating foods. Dogs are predisposed
to indigestion as they frequently swallow a large
quantity of indigestible food without masticating it.
Poor care and exposure to cold also frequently produce
Constipation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Constipation is often a complication of
other diseases, the feces is dry-looking and may be more
or less covered with a mucus. A prominent symptom
is straining, attempts to defecate, the appetite is greatly
impaired, the dog acts dull and stands with the head
down or goes off to some quiet place and lies down.
Protrusion of the rectum or piles may occur, especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
if the animal has eaten freely of dry, indigestible food.
Colicky pains are sometimes manifested. Constipation
occurring from causes other than a complication of diseases
seldom takes on a serious form.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—When a dog becomes constipated, all
dry, indigestible food should be withheld. A soft, easily
digested diet should be fed sparingly and a liberal supply
of water allowed. In some cases it is well to exercise
the dog. A physic of two to four ounces of Castor
Oil should be given, but overdosing with physics avoided.
The action of the physic should be assisted by injecting
into the rectum warm, soapy water. Tonics which assist
digestion by stimulating secretions of the bowels, should
be administered, as Ferri Sulphate, one-half dram;
Quinine, one-half dram; Pulv. Nux Vomica, one-half
dram; Gentian Root, one dram. Mix and make into
twelve capsules and give one capsule three or four times
a day.</p>

<p>The above treatment must be persisted in until the
constipated condition is relieved.</p>

<h3>DIARRHOEA AND DYSENTERY</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Among the common causes of Diarrhoea
and Dysentery can be mentioned irritating foods, sudden
change in feed, decomposed matter, irritation from
intestinal worms, imperfect mastication of food and its
imperfect preparation for digestion, eating more food
than the digestive organs can well digest, debilitated
condition and irritation from indigestible food. The
immediate cause is perhaps the irritated condition of the
mucous membranes lining the intestines and a profuse
secretion from the intestinal glands, nature’s own
method of removing poisonous or infectious matter from
the digestive canal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Undue amount of liquid feces, the dog
weakly and sickly, the coat staring and perhaps a sort
of curdled fluid passes with the feces. If the fecal matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
is tinged with blood, then it is called Dysentery, and
this is more serious than common Diarrhoea. These
conditions are generally associated with other diseases
and should be examined very carefully for complications.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Treatment consists of keeping the
dog as quiet as possible, feed sparingly on clean, easily
digested food, as raw eggs, etc. It may be necessary to
give a dose of physic, as Castor Oil in two to four ounce
doses which is an excellent remedy for expelling irritants
from the bowels without griping. After the cause or
irritant from within the intestines is removed administer
Protan, one-half ounce; Gum Catechu, one-half ounce;
Zinc Sulphocarbolates, two grains. Make into sixteen
capsules and give one capsule every four hours. This
dose is prepared for a dog weighing forty pounds. To
larger dogs or puppies give the same medicine in doses
proportionate to their weight.</p>

<h3>DISTEMPER</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Is due to a specific bacteria that is developed
spontaneously, although I am of the opinion that
insanitary surroundings, as dark, damp, ill-ventilated
quarters play a very active part in its causation as well
as food that is decomposed, contaminated or deficient in
nitrogenous matter, or any condition that has a tendency
to weaken the dog’s constitution.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—The first symptom revealed is a bad
cold. The dog chills, the eyes become inflamed and a
thin watery discharge oozes from them as well as from
the nostrils, and, as the disease progresses, this thin
watery discharge takes on a pus-like character, becomes
thick, yellow, tinged with blood, sticky and very offensive
in smell. The dog vomits and has a dry, husky
cough, the temperature rises from two to four degrees
above normal, the pulse considerably weakened, breathing
hurried and labored and the dog walks around in a
staggering stupor and may even go into convulsions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
There is also a twitching of the muscles in many cases,
as in Chorea, and this disease generally follows Distemper.
In other cases, the dog will lie flat on the side,
breathe with great difficulty, in a half-unconscious manner.
This is a very unfavorable symptom, as lung complications
have developed. Constipation or diarrhoea
and even dysentery that is foul in odor may accompany
this disease. The dog grows very poor, weak, the legs,
nose and ears grow cold and clammy, and death follows.
When the above described symptoms are present, the
dog generally dies in from two to four days. If he lives
through this stage, chances are that he will develop
Chorea and be of practically no value.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—As this disease runs its course in
about eighteen days, good sanitary surroundings are
very beneficial. Pure, fresh air, light, clean and comfortable
place to lie upon are also necessary. Feed albuminous
food, as raw eggs, milk, etc. Beef broth is
very beneficial in many cases; also permit the dog to
have free access to pure water at all times.</p>

<p>If vomiting accompanies the disease, the following
prescription should be administered: Diluted Prussic
Acid, nine drops; Morphine Hydrochlorate, ten grains;
Bismuth Nitrate, one dram; water, quantity sufficient to
make three ounces. Give one tablespoonful not oftener
than six hours. This should be given a dog weighing
forty pounds. Smaller or larger dogs should receive
the same medicine in doses proportionate to their weight.
When constipation is present, give two to four ounces of
Castor Oil. The general medical treatment for Dog
Distemper consists of the following: Quinine Sulphate,
two drams; Potassi Nitrate, three drams; Zinc Sulphocarbolates,
two drams. Mix well and make into twenty-four
capsules and give one capsule every two or three
hours. This dose should be proportionately increased
in dogs weighing over forty pounds, or decreased for
dogs weighing less than forty pounds. Of course a difference
of five pounds should not be considered. Bathe
the nose and eyes several times daily in a five per cent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
solution of Boracic Acid. When complications, as
Chorea or Pneumonia develop, use the treatments as
described under their respective headings.</p>

<h3>ECZEMA<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Surfeit</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Derangements of the digestive canal, dogs
recovering from distemper, or a bitch after whelping, is
predisposed to Eczema. Dogs exposed to a sudden
chilling of the surface of the body, when heated, frequently
develop Surfeit. Sometimes dogs confined to
poorly ventilated, damp kennels develop Eczema, or
Surfeit. In fact, any condition that tends to cause a
sluggishness of the circulation produces impure blood,
and eruptions of the skin naturally follow as a result.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—This disease generally affects the neck,
back, inside the thighs, arms and the abdomen. The
skin becomes red, painful to the touch, small pimples
form and serum oozes from them. This gradually
spreads and the skin becomes raw and ulcerated. The
dog will continue to scratch and bite himself violently,
producing further irritation, if not properly treated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Internal treatment is just as essential
as applications to the skin. Digestive and blood disorders
must be eradicated before the outer surface of
the body will yield to a treatment. Internally, give
Fowler’s Solution of Arsenic, two to eight drops, three
times daily in the food. The drug should be given at
first in small doses and gradually increased as tolerance
is established. If the bowels are sluggish, give one to
three grains of Calomel. This will relieve any irritant
in the alimentary canal. Feed food that is easily digested,
as vegetables, Cod Liver Oil, etc. Beef Broth
is beneficial, but a heavy meat diet should be discontinued.
To the irritated surface of the skin, the following
is soothing as well as healing: Zinc Oxide, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
ounce; Pisis Liquid, one ounce; Mercurial Ointment,
one ounce. Mix and apply sparingly once a day.
Poisons are readily absorbed through the skin, therefore,
be very careful when using powerful antiseptics
over a large surface of the body.</p>

<h3>EYE INJURIES<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Conjunctivitis</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Direct or indirect injuries, as a blow from a
whip, dust, sand or chaff in the eye, or may be due to
extreme cold, or heat, or foul air.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—An inflammation of the superficial
structures of the eye, with a partial or complete closure,
and a watery discharge due to the overstimulation
of the lachrymal glands, the fluid being secreted so
abundantly that it is impossible for the tear duct to
carry it away, hence there will be a continuous flow of
tears running down the side of the dog’s face. The
formation of a film or a scum over the eyes need not
cause alarm if the eyeball shows no sign of being lacerated
or punctured.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Examine the eye carefully and remove
any foreign body with a clean cloth or feather,
and use a solution made from distilled water containing
three per cent Boric Acid, and apply ten or twelve
drops to the eye by the use of an ordinary eye-dropper.
Keep the animal in a clean, dark room, as it hastens
recovery and avoids other serious eye complications.</p>

<h3>FITS<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Epilepsy</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Usually arises from excessive nervous irritation,
induced by disturbances of the stomach and
bowels from the presence of worms, indigestible food,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
etc., or it may arise occasionally from a hereditary predisposition,
sexual excess, urine irritation, or from other
causes inducing extreme nervousness, irritability, etc.
Dogs affected with this disease are usually troubled with
dyspepsia and constipation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—The leading symptoms of the disease
are sudden loss of consciousness, with spasms of muscles,
followed by exhaustion and drowsiness. After a certain
length of time has passed, the attack returns. About
five or ten per cent of the cases give some warning for
a short time before the fits come on, but in most cases
the fit comes on suddenly, the dog whines, and at once
falls to the ground senseless with convulsions. The eyes
are partly open, the eyeballs rolling, and a gnawing of
the teeth, foaming at the mouth; the tongue is usually
extended out, and many times badly bitten. The nose
is usually cold and clammy and breathing laborious.
The fit usually lasts from a few minutes to one-half
hour, but in some cases continues for longer time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—The dog should be placed on a blanket
to prevent inhalations of dust, etc., remove the collar
from around the neck, and apply cold applications of
ice to the head. The remedy most to be relied upon is
Bromide of Potassium, and should be given to a dog
weighing forty pounds in doses of twenty grains three
times a day. The dose to larger or smaller dogs should
be given in proportion to their weight. If necessary,
the dose may be increased one-third for a short time.
Also give Castor Oil, one to two ounces. To puppies
give in proportion to their weight. Pay strict attention
to the organs of digestion, and see that the nourishment
taken is sufficient to nourish the body well, but be careful
not to have an over-amount at one time. Also regulate
the feed so as to always have five or six hours elapse
between feeds. It is advisable to give a vermifuge
in all cases of fits, as worms are frequently producers
of the malady.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<h3>FRACTURES<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Bone Fractures</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—There are several different varieties of
fractures, but for convenience sake I will divide them
into four varieties:</p>

<p>1. Simple fracture is one in which a bone is broken
and the muscles and skin are not severely injured.</p>

<p>2. Compound fracture is one in which the sharp
ends of the broken bone penetrate and perhaps pass
through the skin. This is considered a rather severe
fracture.</p>

<p>3. Comminuted fracture is one in which a broken
bone is badly shattered.</p>

<p>4. Complicated fracture is one in which important
articular joints and large arteries are injured.</p>

<p>Some people imagine that the bones of the dog will
not unite as quickly as the bones of man, but I am of
the opinion that they will unite quicker if the bones are
properly placed and the animal kept quiet. I will admit
that fractures are somewhat troublesome to treat in some
cases, although I have seen dogs with severe fractures
make good recoveries without any assistance other than
that of nature. In treating a fracture where the bones
penetrate the skin, cut the hair from around the surface
and wash with a five per cent solution of Carbolic Acid.
Place the broken bones in position, wrap the surface
with a thin layer of cotton and retain the bones in position
with splints and bandages. Keep the animal as
quiet as possible and feed on soft laxative good. If
bowels become constipated, give two to four ounces of
Castor Oil. If severe swelling follows in a few days,
and the dog shows signs of great pain, remove the bandage
and wash clean with an antiseptic. Then place
fresh cotton around the part and bandage the same as
before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<h3>GOITER<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Bronchocele</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Generally associated with a debilitated condition
of a heavy pregnant bitch that is poorly fed, and
exposed to various temperatures. The offspring of such
a bitch are very often victims of Goiter. When the
puppies are born the mother’s milk lacks sufficient nitrogenous
properties; they are consequently deprived of
mineral matter and develop Goiter. Some writers hold
that this is hereditary, because one or more puppies
become affected at the same time. I believe that it is
due to debility, starvation, and what produces it in one
dog will produce it in another. Although full-grown
dogs are often victims of Goiters, it is due to some
debilitated condition drawing on their systems. Even
though the dog looks well, and appears to be in good
condition, his food may be deficient in mineral properties.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Enlargement of the Thyroid bodies of
the ductless gland situated on the under surface of the
neck. It may vary from the size of a pigeon’s egg to
the size of a man’s two fists. It is very easily detected,
and does not often interfere with the animal’s breathing
unless it becomes abnormally large and causes pressure
on the windpipe, jugular vein and esophagus. A dog
affected with Goiter does not thrive, his hair looks faded,
dusty and rough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Administer Adrenolin twice daily in
five to ten grain doses half an hour before feeding, and
two to five grains of Potassium Iodide two times daily
shortly after feeding. The Potassium Iodide should be
discontinued when the skin scales, or when an abnormal
watery discharge from the eyes is present. To the enlargement
apply Tincture of Iodine once a day with a
camelhair brush. If the dog has long hair, clip it off
from over the enlargement. Feed the dog on nitrogenous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
foods, as raw eggs, Cod Liver Oil, Beef Broth,
and also supply him with soft bones to chew. Where
the bowels are constipated, give one to two ounces of
Castor Oil. The above medicines prescribed are prescribed
for dogs weighing forty pounds, and should be
increased when given to larger, or decreased when given
to smaller dogs proportionately to their weight. See
that the dog has clean, light and well ventilated quarters
to sleep in.</p>

<h3>INDIGESTION<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Dyspepsia</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Intestinal worms, indigestible and unnutritious
food, foreign bodies in the stomach, eating too
large a quantity or, in many cases, eating too fast, torpidity
of the liver, derangements of the teeth, as the
accumulations of tartar cause the gums to become soft
and sore, resulting in the dog not taking sufficient time
to chew food properly; excessive or inexcessive exercise,
or improper attention to the hygienic surroundings often
derange the digestive system.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—The appetite is depraved, the dog eats
grass freely, and vomits often; colicky pains, persistent
constipation and bloating, causing the dog serious inconvenience.
He is irritable, dull and evidently out of
sorts; his coat looks faded and feels rough; the temperature
and pulse are not much affected; as a rule the breath
is foul, the tongue covered with a whitish fur, loss of flesh
occurs, and paleness of the skin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Good hygiene, careful feeding of
nitrogenous foods and regular exercise plays a very important
part in the treatment of indigestion. First, endeavor
to clean out the Alimentary Canal by the careful
use of physics, as Calomel in one to three grain doses.
Feed raw eggs, sweet milk, boiled vegetables, fresh raw
beef finely chopped. Also give one tablespoonful of
Cod Liver Oil two or three times a day. I have derived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
good results in the treatment of Indigestion by using
the following gastric tonic: Pepsin, two ounces; Syrup
of Orange, two ounces; Tincture of Columbia, five
drams; Tincture Nux Vomica, one dram; Tincture
Gentian, one dram; water, quantity sufficient to make
six ounces. Mix and give one or two teaspoonfuls three
times daily before feeding. In cases where there is
great difficulty in the dog passing the feces, give rectal
injections of soap and warm water.</p>

<h3>JAUNDICE<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Liver Congestion</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—A sluggishness of the liver, or by the bile
duct becoming obstructed by a Calculi (Gall Stone).
Either condition suppresses the flow of bile into the
bowels, hence the bile is taken up by the blood and causes
the visible mucous membranes of the eyes and mouth
to become yellowish in color. The predisposing causes
are improper and overfeeding, combined with lack of
exercise in house dogs, or excessive exercise in hunting
dogs, exposure to damp, ill-ventilated sleeping quarters,
producing debility, and liver complications are likely to
follow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Appetite varied, thirst great, vomiting
occasionally, the dog shows signs of dullness and sleepiness.
Then there may be alternate diarrhoea and constipation,
the tongue coated and foul in smell, the eyes,
mouth, inside of the ears, and the skin inside the thighs
and fore legs become very yellow and dry, temperature
and pulse not much affected, the dog passes small quantities
of dark amber colored urine frequently, due to
the bile it contains. In severe cases, the dog loses
strength and flesh readily and soon becomes a mere
skeleton. Jaundice is often a complication of other diseases,
as distemper, indigestion, colic, constipation, etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Endeavor to make the dog as comfortable
as possible by placing him in quiet, clean, light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
and well ventilated quarters. If he is in great pain,
apply hot applications over the seat of pain and administer
Calomel, one-half grain; Podophyllin, two grains;
Powdered Jalap, one dram; Powdered Rhubarb, one
dram. Make into six capsules and give one capsule once
daily to a dog weighing forty pounds; to smaller or
larger dogs regulate the dose in proportion to their
weight. The above prescription stimulates the flow of
bile from the liver into the bowels, which is very important
in the treatment of Jaundice. Tonics are also necessary,
and I have found the following very beneficial in
treating convalescing diseases, especially where the appetite
is poor: Pulv. Ferri Sulphate, one dram; Quinine
Sulphate, one dram; Pulv. Nux Vomica, one dram;
Pulv. Gentian Root, two drams. Mix and make into
twenty-four capsules and give one capsule three times
daily just before feeding. This dose should be given to
a dog weighing about forty pounds. Smaller or larger
dogs should receive the same medicine in doses proportionate
to their weight. Feed raw eggs, pure sweet
milk, fresh beef finely chopped, cooked vegetables, beef
broth, etc. Do not feed too large a quantity at any one
time.</p>

<h3>LUNG FEVER<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Congestion of the Lungs—Pneumonia</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Frequently occurs when dogs are accustomed
to warm, comfortable quarters, then exposed to
cold, drafty kennels during cold weather. In fact, any
sudden chilling of the body is a common cause of lung
disorders. Giving fat dogs too much exercise when
they are not accustomed to it is frequently the cause of
engorgement and inflammation of the soft spongy tissue
of the lungs. Excessive exercise or running during the
hot summer months is apt to cause congestion of the
lung tissue as well as heat stroke. Washing or dipping
dogs during cold weather may chill the outer surface of
the body and result in Congestion of the Lungs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Lung Fever follows as a result of a
bad cold, and is preceded by the symptoms of the primary
disease. If due to severe exercise, the animal appears
greatly exhausted, and the congestion of the lung
substance is marked and may occur at this stage of the
disease. Lung Fever usually begins with a chill, and
is followed by a high fever. The dog lies down most
of the time, and eats nothing, or very little. The breathing
is hurried and fast, but when the lung becomes badly
involved it is labored. The character of the pulse beat
varies, depending on the extent of the inflammation and
the stage of the disease. In most cases the pulse beats
are full and quick during the first stage, but later, as
the condition of the dog improves, more nearly normal.
A very weak pulse is present in severe and fatal lung
inflammation. The visible mucous membranes of the
eyes and mouth have a congested appearance, and there
may be a slight discharge from the nostrils, reddish in
color. The expression of the face is distressed and
anxious, and in severe cases, rigors and chilling of the
body occur. The respiratory sounds become more or
less changed from normal. The cough is at first deep
and dry, later loose and moist. It may be accompanied
by a hemorrhage of the lungs during the first stages of
the disease. Other respiratory sounds are revealed by
placing the ear to the side of the chest wall and listening.
In the very early stages of lung fever, a crepitating, or
crackling sound can be heard in the diseased parts; and
louder sounds than normal in the healthy areas. Later,
when the engorgement of the lung substance occurs, and
the air cells become filled by the inflammatory exudation,
the respiratory sounds are deadened. On returning to
the normal, rattling sounds occur. These signs aid
greatly in determining the dog’s condition. The chance
for recovery depends on the extent and acuteness of the
disease. Careless handling, exercise, etc., lessens the
chance for a favorable termination in this disease, and
good nursing helps more in bringing about a recovery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
than the medical treatment. The chances are more unfavorable
in fat dogs than in lean ones, as the inflammation
is usually more severe in the former. The course
of the disease is from one to three weeks, and it may
become chronic if the irritation is kept up. In such
cases, unthriftiness is a prominent sign.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Preventive treatment in Lung Fever
must not be overlooked. Briefly, it consists in avoiding
such conditions as may predispose the dog to the disease,
or act in any way as an exciting cause. Careful nursing
is a very important part of the treatment. The dog
should be given a clean, comfortable, well ventilated
kennel, and kept as quiet as possible. To keep the
bowels from becoming constipated, give one-half to one
ounce of Castor Oil daily. Feed raw eggs, pure fresh
milk, beef broth, etc. In severe cold weather, the dog
must not be permitted to chill or take more cold. Cover
him with a blanket, or use artificial heat. As one attack
predisposes a dog to the second, he should be protected
from severe cold, or the other extreme, heat, for a few
weeks after making a complete recovery. It is advisable
to apply strong stimulating liniments over the
lungs, as Aqua Ammonia Fort., one ounce; Oil of Turpentine,
one ounce; Sweet Oil, two ounces. Shake well
and apply once daily.</p>

<p>I have found the following prescription very beneficial
in the treatment of Lung Fever, as it regulates the
heart action, lowers the temperature and stimulates the
body in general: Tincture Digitalis, one dram; Tincture
Nux Vomica, one dram; Nitrous Ether, two drams;
Liq. Ammonia Acet., four drams; water, quantity sufficient
to make four ounces. Give one teaspoonful every
two or three hours.</p>

<p>All drugs prescribed in the above treatment are
based on a dog weighing forty pounds. Larger or
smaller dogs should receive the same medicine but in
doses proportionate to their weight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<h3>MAMMITIS<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Garget, or Inflammation of the Udder</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Inflammation of the Udder commonly occurs
in heavy milkers, and is caused by all the milk not
being removed. Sometimes it occurs as the result of the
milk accumulating in the udder when the bitch has lost
part of her litter. Other causes are obstructed teats,
injuries to the glandular tissues, and infection from
germs. Congestion and inflammation of the udder frequently
follow difficult birth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Milk the bitch three or four times a
day. This will usually relieve the congestion. A physic
of Castor Oil, one or two ounces, should be given and
the animal fed on easily digested food, as boiled vegetables,
fresh raw beef finely chopped, pure sweet milk,
etc. The udder should be massaged gently with the
fingers, and the following ointment applied: Gum
Camphor, one dram; Fluid Extracts of Belladonna, one
dram; Lanolin, three ounces. Mix and apply two or
three times daily. Fomentations of hot water are beneficial
in the majority of cases. If the appetite is deprived,
administer Nitrate of Potash, two drams; Pulv.
Nux Vomica, one dram; Pulv. Gentian Root, one dram.
Mix and make into twenty-four capsules and give one
capsule three times daily before feeding. This dose is
based on a dog weighing forty pounds. Smaller or
larger dogs should receive the same medicine, but in
doses proportionate to their weight.</p>

<h3>MANGE</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—This skin eruption is produced by the Sarcoptes
Scabi. There are two other forms of parasites
that produce Mange, but they are so rarely found that
we need not mention them. Insanitary conditions favor
their production. A dog in a poor condition, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
dirty skin, etc., is more liable to be attacked than dogs
in good condition and with clean skins. It may be communicated
in various ways, through kennels, brushes,
collars, etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Are generally very plain. It usually
attacks the back, about the root of the tail, and extends
to the head and neck, spreading quickly. The scabs do
not pile up as they do on other large animals, because
the dogs, on account of the intense itching, continually
rub and scratch themselves so that only thin scabs can
form. The affected skin becomes denude of hair, the
dog becomes thin, emaciated, etc. The parasites can
be seen with an ordinary magnifying glass, or if the
small scabs be scraped off and placed on a dark paper in
the warm sun, you can readily see small, white objects
moving about. Eczema usually attacks the belly, etc.,
while true Sarcoptic Mange attacks the back and then
spreads.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Feed soft, laxative food and give one
to two ounces of Castor Oil; also provide clean, dry
sleeping quarters. I have found the following remedy
very successful in the treatment of Mange: Oil of Tar,
one-half ounce; Vinice Turpentine, two ounces; Sublime
Sulphur, one pound; Crude Petrolatum, one quart. Apply
once a day. A few applications are generally sufficient
to effect a cure. Great care should be exercised,
as this disease is very contagious, and communicated
to other dogs.</p>

<h3>PLEURISY</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—The common cause, perhaps, is a sudden
chilling of the body; cold, damp, chilly weather and
damp, drafty kennels are favorable conditions to cause
chilling of the body and the rheumatic form of Pleurisy.
Germs may also produce it. It is commonly met with
in specific diseases, as Distemper, etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Chilling and high temperature, two to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
four degrees above normal, the dog generally refuses
to eat, and acts dull. Pain is a noticeable sign, and
when the sides of the chest are pressed with the hand
the dog will flinch; this is very noticeable during the
early stage of the inflammation, and may cause a dog
to act restless. When breathing the ribs are always
held rigid. The breathing movements are mostly in the
muscles of the flanks, the dog getting his breath in short
jerks. Later, when fluids collect in the chest cavity, the
breathing is more labored, and all of the abdominal
muscles are used. On absorption of this fluid, the movements
of the lungs may again become jerky in case the
inflammation becomes chronic. The character of the
pulse beats varies, and in some cases is very weak. In
the early stage of the disease, friction sounds, caused by
the dry inflamed membranes rubbing against each other,
are detected on placing the ear against the chest walls.
Later, the collection of fluids around the lungs may
deaden all lung sounds, especially towards the lower
part of the chest. In a mild case of Pleurisy, the inflammation
is localized to just part of the lungs, or
pleura. A lameness in both front limbs and stiffness in
moving about are the most noticeable signs in this form
of disease. In Chronic Pleurisy a dog is usually very
weak and depressed. He is seen frequently lying on
his side, and shows great difficulty in walking. The
course of Acute Pleurisy is from six to eighteen days;
the chronic form may run a course of two or three
months, or longer. This form is unsatisfactorily treated,
and the dog eventually dies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Place the dog in clean, warm, comfortable
surroundings; fresh air is very beneficial, but
omit any drafts. Internally, administer the following:
Quinine Sulphate, two drams; Potassium Iodide, two
drams; Carbonate of Ammonia, one dram; Potassium
Nitrate, four drams. Mix and make into thirty-two
capsules. Give one capsule every three or four hours.
This dose is based on a dog weighing forty pounds; to
smaller or larger dogs give the same medicine, but in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
doses proportionate to their weight. Feed the dog
raw eggs, pure fresh milk, cooked vegetables, finely
chopped beef or beef broth, and in some cases I believe
it is very beneficial to give the dog small doses of brandy.
Over the lungs apply the following liniment: Aqua
Ammonia Fort., one ounce; Oil of Turpentine, one
ounce; Sweet Oil, two ounces. Shake well and apply
like a shampoo once daily.</p>

<h3>PILES<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Prolapse of the Rectum</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Overfeeding with too stimulating food, deficiency
in exercise, constipation, causing straining; consequently,
Piles frequently follows. This condition
sometimes occurs in weak, debilitated dogs, due to a relaxed
condition of the intestines.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—In some cases only a portion of the
rectal mucous membrane protrudes outside of the anus.
In the more severe cases red, bleeding tumors will be
present. After being exposed for a time, it becomes
enormously swollen and dark in color, and finally dries
and cracks on its surface. The protruded part itches
intensely, and the dog rubs and injures the intestine
trying to relieve the irritation. Usually the appetite
falls off, and the dog is restless if not relieved.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—When the dog is constipated, as is
usually the case it should be given a laxative, such as
one to three ounces of Castor Oil, and fed on food that
is loosening to the bowels. The protruded rectal mucous
membrane should be washed with warm water containing
five per cent Carbolic Acid until clean; then replace.
If badly swollen and inflamed, astringent wash should
be used, made from Water and Powdered Alum five
per cent. The protrusion can be returned by gentle
pressure of the fingers. In case the protruded rectum
shows signs of sloughing, it should be cut off and the
cut edges of the rectum stitched to the edges of the anus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<h3>RABIES<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Mad Dog</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Rabies is produced by a specific micro-organism
that is known to exist in the brain, spinal cord
and the saliva of affected animals. This disease is
communicated from one animal to another by inoculation,
usually by the bite of a rabied dog, or the
saliva entering a wound or abrasion. Wild animals, as
well as domesticated, no doubt spread the disease by
biting, but it is a fact that dogs are inclined to bite, and
have a good opportunity to attack people, and hence
are considered the principal factor in the spread of the
disease.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Are characterized by two forms of
Rabies: Furious and Dumb. In Furious Rabies, the
general habits of the dogs are changed. They become
very restless, excited, and frequently are more affectionate
than usual, licking the hands or face, soliciting sympathy
and help. This form of Rabies is extremely
dangerous, for the dog’s tongue is covered with saliva
containing micro-organisms which, coming in contact
with thin skin, wounds or abrasions, may inoculate the
person to whom the dog is attempting to prove its fondness,
etc. This form of inoculation is not uncommon.
Usually, the dog becomes dull, melancholy, etc., seeking
some cool, dark and quiet place. The eyes at times are
fixed, or are rolled about, and there is an abundant
secretion of saliva, which dribbles from the mouth. It
frequently gnaws wood, especially if tied or locked up,
and makes a desperate effort to get away. It also swallows
indigestible objects, and attempts to bite its master,
mistress and animals. Paralysis soon develops, and the
dog has difficulty in swallowing, and is unable to move
about.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dumb Rabies.</span>—This form of Rabies is accompanied
by depression and a tendency to lick objects.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Paralysis of the muscles that close the mouth causes
the jaw to drop or hang down. The dog is unable to
bite and, owing to the relaxed conditions of the mouth,
he cannot close it. The tongue hangs out, and stringy
saliva escapes. The dog may attempt to bite even
though the muscles that close the mouth are paralyzed.
The duration of the disease is short; paralysis develops
early in the attack, and death usually occurs in from
two to four days.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Prevention. All vagrant dogs should
be exterminated, and all dogs that appear in public highways,
streets or public places should be muzzled. This
precaution has practically eradicated the disease in
Europe. Medical treatment is useless after the first
appearance of the symptoms. However, a wound infected
by Rabies should be immediately cauterized, or
even completely cut away, care being taken to cut entirely
around the wound in the healthy flesh. For cauterizing
the wound, use Nitric Acid or a hot iron.
Sometimes a ten per cent solution of Zinc Chloride is
used, and perhaps it is the most successful. To afford
absolute protection, this should be done within a few
minutes after being bitten. However, treatment even
as late as a few hours has been known to suppress the
development of the disease. Pasteur has originated a
virus which is used with great success, and any person
bitten by a dog suspected of Rabies should be submitted
to Pasteur’s treatment.</p>

<h3>RHEUMATISM<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Articular and Muscular</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—This disease is generally attributed to cold,
damp, filthy, ill-ventilated kennels, and exposure, but it
may occur in dogs that are well cared for. Overfeeding
is also liable to produce it. The most frequent forms of
Rheumatism in dogs are Lumbago, Chest Founder, or
Kennel Lameness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—The symptoms are quite marked.
These are severe loss of appetite, lameness and general
lack of condition. Sometimes large swellings appear
in the region of the hock, knee, and joints of the feet.
The muscles of the back are held stiff and arched, the
muscles are tender and sensitive when pressed, and the
dog may be unable to move his hind parts. Other cases
may show a serious train of symptoms. A bitch that
has raised a litter of pups, when in poor flesh, is often
affected with this disease. A lameness of one or more
of the limbs that shows a tendency to shift about is the
only sign noticed in the mild form of the disease. Stiffness
of the joints is noticed, especially if the quarters
are affected, and the dog lies around a good share of
the time and refuses to go far for its food. In Acute
Rheumatism, the pain in the affected muscles and joints
is intense, and when these parts are handled, or the
joints moved, the dog will whine from the pain produced.
When lying down, asleep, sudden contractions
of the muscles may be noticed. This is due to the pain
resulting from the relaxing of the muscles. This disease
may pursue a long course; the joints become greatly
enlarged, and the dog grows very thin and weak. In
such cases, a complete recovery seldom follows.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Prevention is very important, such
as providing dry, comfortable quarters, and the avoidance
of exposure. Unless this is practiced, but little
can be obtained from medical treatment. A soft laxative
diet is also indicated: Salicylate Soda, three
drams; Quinine Sulphate, one dram. Make into twenty
capsules and give one capsule every three or four hours.
When the bowels are constipated, give two or three
ounces of Castor Oil. The above doses are based on a
dog weighing forty pounds. Smaller or larger dogs
should receive the same medicine but proportionately to
their weight. It is advisable, in cases where the limbs
are badly swollen, to apply liniments, and I would recommend
the following: Aqua Ammonia Fort., two
ounces; Oil of Turpentine, two ounces; Sweet Oil, four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
ounces. Shake and rub on the affected parts once or
twice daily.</p>

<h3>RICKETS</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Perhaps the most common cause of this
disease is a faulty diet, as food that is deficient in inorganic
matter. Unless supplemented by milk or other
foods containing lime salt, the bones are not supplied
with the necessary elements; lack of exercise, ill-ventilated,
filthy kennels, etc., help in causing the disease.
A tendency towards Rickets in pups is no doubt hereditary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—The dog is usually in good condition at
the beginning of the disease. Large, well grown pups
may suddenly develop symptoms of paralysis of the
hind parts. The weakened condition of the thigh bone,
not being able to support the dog’s weight, fractures.
At other times there is a weakness and bending of bones
in the limbs, breaking down of the feet, bending or arching
of the back, straddling gait, deformed or disfigured
condition of the face or nose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Rickets can be prevented by careful
feeding on suitable foods and keeping the dog clean in
well ventilated kennels, where he can get plenty of exercise.
Whenever a litter of several pups show symptoms
of the disease, the character of the food should be looked
into, and if faulty corrected by adding to it medicines
or food containing required elements. It is hardly
practical to use medical treatment other than bitter
tonics. Unless the disease is in an advanced stage, it
can usually be controlled by careful feeding of a ration
rich in inorganic substances, as bone dust, lime water,
and crushed egg shells, with a view of supplying calcareous
matter to the system. This can be fed to the
bitch nursing the pups or, if the pups are weaned, feed
them carefully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<h3>RINGWORM</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Dogs may become infected with Ringworm
by coming in contact with infected dogs, or by being
shipped in crates or boxes in which infected dogs have
recently been transported, or by using blankets, brushes,
collars, etc., which have been recently used by infected
dogs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Small red spots first appear on the
skin, gradually enlarging, and are covered with a thin,
grayish scale, under which is found a serum. The hair
falls out as a result of the infection of the skin by the
parasite. The outside of the affected patches is red,
while the inner portion takes on a grayish-white color,
giving it a ring appearance. This condition is followed
by severe itching; the dog rubs and scratches severely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—The most effective drug is Tincture
of Iodine, applied once daily with a brush. Great care
must be exercised, as this disease may be transmitted to
man, and to all domestic animals. Sanitary surroundings
and good, clean food, that is easily digested, assists
materially in eradicating the parasites.</p>

<h3>ROUNDWORMS<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Maw Worms</i>)</span></h3>

<p>This worm is commonly seen infesting the intestines
of puppies. The body is generally white in color and
slightly curved at the head. This worm has a stiff, wiry
appearance, and measures from one to three and one-half
inches in length.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Puppies are more susceptible to these
worms, although we find them in aged dogs. About
fifty per cent of the dogs are infested with these worms.
They cause irritation of the intestines, irregularity of
digestion, diarrhoea, colic, nervousness, constipation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
irregular appetite and a rough, dry, unthrifty appearance
of the hair and skin, and the dog becomes emaciated.
After this worm migrates into the stomach, it causes
nausea and vomiting, occasionally the bowels are filled
with large masses of these worms, and their passage
aids in determining the cause of the dog’s debility.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Withhold all food from eighteen to
twenty-four hours and administer Thymol, one grain;
Santonin, three grains; Calomel, two grains. Mix and
place in capsule and give in one dose to a dog weighing
fifty pounds. Smaller or larger dogs should receive the
same prescription, but in doses proportionate to their
weight.</p>

<h3>SORE THROAT<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Pharyngitis—Laryngitis</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—Sore Throat is frequently complicated by
a cold. Sometimes it is produced by inhaling irritating
gases, or administering irritating medicine. Injuries
from sharp pointed sticks, eating sharp bones, etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—It is more or less severe. The eyes are
red and watery, and the dog is dull and lies around most
of the time. The appetite is poor and, because of the
pain and difficulty in swallowing, the dog may refuse
food. The pain in the throat is sometimes severe, and
causes the dog to move about in a restless manner. The
character of the cough depends on the part inflamed.
When the larynx (opening of the windpipe) is involved,
the cough is usually hoarse and the breathing noisy and
labored, as the opening is more or less closed by the
inflammation. At other times it is dry and, when the
dog moves about, or the parts are irritated by dust, cold
air, etc., coughing spells usually follow. The throat
may be swollen so as to be noticeable from the outside.
Simple Sore Throat is not a serious affection, and lasts
but a short time. The symptoms may be so mild as to
escape observation; however, if the conditions are favorable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
it may re-occur and assume a severe form or become
chronic.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Place the dog in clean, warm, well
ventilated quarters and feed soft food that is easily
digested, as hot milk, boiled rice, etc., and administer the
following: Potassium Chlorate, one dram; Liq. Ammonia
Acet., three ounces; Vini Ipecac, two drams;
Tincture Camph. Co., one-half ounce; Aqua Chloroform,
quantity sufficient to make six ounces. Give one
teaspoonful every four hours. This dose is based on a
dog weighing forty pounds. To smaller or larger dogs
give doses in proportion to their weight. When the
throat becomes badly swollen, apply a liniment made
from equal parts of Aqua Ammonia Fort., Turpentine
and Sweet Oil. Apply over the throat and rub in
briskly.</p>

<h3>TAPEWORM<br />
<span class="smaller">(<i>Tenia Marginata</i>)</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—A dog eating raw flesh of sheep or cattle
infested with the larva of the Tapeworm or Gid, Sturdy,
or Water Balls. (See Gid in Sheep.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—Tapeworms in dogs are numerous. It
must be borne in mind that an animal is not free from
them until the Tapeworm’s head, apparently the most
insignificant part, has passed from the intestines. So
long as the head remains attached to the wall of the
bowels by its hooklets it will develop fresh eggs, producing
segments which are passed and prove the means
of scattering the parasites. A dog infected with Tapeworm,
as a rule, is liable to reflex paralysis, coughing
and convulsions from the irritation caused by its presence
in the bowels, depraved appetite, unthriftiness, a
rough, unhealthy condition of the skin, loss of hair,
anemia, irregularity of the bowels, and the feces offensive
and slimy. There is generally a certain amount of
irritation of the anus, which renders the dog fond of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
licking those parts or dragging them along on the
ground. Tapeworms frequently cause vomiting, and I
have seen portions of Tapeworms expelled in this way.
In other cases there may be diarrhoea and obstinate indigestion
may be traced to the presence of Tapeworms.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Withhold all food for twenty-four
hours and administer Extract of Mail Fern, two drams;
Pulv. Areca Nut, one dram. Mix in two tablespoonfuls
of syrup and give at one dose. Follow this treatment
in about two hours with one to two ounces of
Castor Oil. This treatment should be repeated in a
week or ten days. These doses are based on a dog
weighing forty pounds. Smaller or larger dogs should
receive the same medicine, but in doses proportionate to
their weight.</p>

<h3>VOMITION</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause.</span>—This is a symptom which shows itself in
almost any disease to which the dog is subject, so extensive
are the reflex influences which follow disease in a
dog. This process of Vomiting can be brought about
in the dog by means of many medicines, and the good
effect of emetics is appreciable even to the most casual
observer. This class of medicines has been much abused
by those caring for sick dogs, emetics being given for
any and every disease. They sometimes free the stomach
of irritants and poisons which cause disease and
poisoning, but their use requires care and judgment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span>—The dog shows very marked symptoms
of pain, but usually the first signs exhibited are those
of a sense of discomfort. The dog moans in his sleep,
wakes suddenly, curls himself up and goes to sleep
again. This continues until at last the vomiting is too
urgent to allow rest. The dog utters sharp, shrill, continuous
cries, tries all sorts of positions to get itself at
ease, and walks about with the back arched. There may
be distention of the abdomen, due to the gases generated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
in the bowels from the fermentation of their contents.
Colicky symptoms frequently accompany vomiting,
due to the spasmodic contractions of the stomach
relieving itself of some irritant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—Knowing that the causes operating
in the production of Vomiting are so numerous, it will
be easily understood that the treatment must be equally
variable. If due to the torpidity of the liver, give
Calomel, one to two grains. When worms are suspected,
give worm treatment recommended under the
heading of Worms. When due to poisoning, give milk
and raw eggs. In case it is due to faulty digestion, or
where a dog is recovering from some debilitating disease,
give one-fourth to one-half teaspoonful of Baking
Soda in a gelatin capsule two or three times a day. The
following prescription is recommended when all suspected
irritants are removed from the stomach: Diluted
Prussic Acid (B. P.), twelve drops; Bismuth Nitrate,
one dram; Lime Water, four ounces. Mix and give
one tablespoonful three times daily. This dose is based
on a dog weighing fifty pounds. Smaller or larger
dogs should receive the same prescription, but in doses
proportionate to their weight. This medicine should be
administered with great precaution, as it is very poisonous
when used in larger doses, or given at shorter intervals
than above recommended.</p>

<h3>WOUNDS</h3>

<p>A wound is a disruption of the soft parts of the
body due to external violence. Wounds are of various
kinds, as incised, lacerated, punctured, gunshot and
poisonous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>—If a wound is extensive, and bleeding
is present, first arrest it, and the most satisfactory
method is as follows: Tie the artery from which the
blood is escaping, or twist with forceps, cauterize with
hot iron, compress by bandaging tightly and apply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Tincture of Chloride of Iron. This coagulates the
blood, and is very effective. One important factor in
treating wounds is to attend to the drainage, as decomposed
matter absorbed into the blood produces blood
poisoning. Dogs lick wounds and keep them clean,
therefore it is hardly necessary to apply medicine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sewing Wounds.</span>—I cannot recommend sewing except
in cases of incised or clean-cut wounds. After
clipping the hair from around the incision, and washing
it thoroughly with a one in one-thousandth solution of
Bichloride, stitch with cat-gut or absorbent silk suture.
In case of deep, punctured or gunshot wounds, with a
syringe wash out the wounds, using a one in one-thousandth
Bichloride solution. For open wounds, use dusting
powders, as Iodoform, Boracic Acid, etc.</p>

<p>To keep flies from annoying a wounded dog, apply
the following prescription: Oil of Origanum, one
ounce; Oil of Turpentine, one ounce; Sweet Oil, one
ounce. Apply to and around the wound with a feather.
This is also a good healing liniment as well as a fly
repellent.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
